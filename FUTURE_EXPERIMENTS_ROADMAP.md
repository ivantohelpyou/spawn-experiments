- **UI Integration**: Add frontend skills to methodology comparison
- **Advanced Topics**: Security and distributed systems after core patterns established

### **Real-World Relevance**
- **Modern Stack**: Focus on technologies actively used in current development
- **Business Value**: Choose applications that mirror common business requirements
- **Portfolio Diversity**: Ensure broad coverage of development domains

### **Research Questions to Answer**
1. **Scalability**: How do methodologies handle increasing complexity?
2. **Integration**: Which approaches better handle cross-cutting concerns?
3. **Maintenance**: How do different approaches impact long-term code evolution?
