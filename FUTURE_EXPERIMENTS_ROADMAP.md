# Future Experiments Roadmap - Tiered Architecture System

## Current Status

### Completed Experiments
1. **002 - Expression Evaluator** (Math/Parsing) - 35 min total
2. **006 - Simple Interest Calculator** (Basic Math/CLI) - Smoke test
3. **008 - LRU Cache with TTL** (Data Structures/Performance) - 13 min max per method
4. **009 - Multilingual Word Counter** (Text Processing/I18N) - ⚠️ **BIAS VIOLATION** - needs rerun

### Key Insights Discovered
- **Time Convergence**: Most methods complete in 8-14 minutes regardless of approach
- **Parallel Launch Success**: Simultaneous execution proven feasible
- **Scope Ambiguity Problem**: Different methodologies solve different scopes of problems
- **Component Discovery**: Natural reuse patterns vary significantly by methodology

## New Experimental Framework: Three-Tier System

Based on lessons learned, future experiments follow a **crawl-walk-run** progression:

### **Tier 1: Functions (010-019) - CRAWL**
**Scope**: Pure algorithmic problems, single functions, stdlib only
**Duration**: 5-15 minutes per approach (30-60 min total parallel)
**Claude Code Usage**: ✅ **Safe for any usage window**
**Purpose**: Isolate methodology differences without architectural complexity

#### Next Experiments
- **010 - Palindrome Detector**: String manipulation and normalization
- **011 - Prime Number Generator**: Algorithm choice and optimization
- **012 - Anagram Grouper**: Hash key strategy and grouping logic
- **013 - Roman Numeral Converter**: Mapping strategy and edge cases
- **014 - Balanced Parentheses**: Stack management and character matching

### **Tier 2: CLI Tools (020-029) - WALK**
**Scope**: Command-line utilities, file I/O, composable tools
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes per approach (60-120 min total parallel)
**Claude Code Usage**: ⚠️ **Requires >2 hours remaining**
**Purpose**: Study interface design and component composition
**Components Available**: Discoverable functions from Tier 1

#### Next Experiments
- **020 - Text Statistics Tool**: wc-like utility with multiple output formats
- **021 - Log Parser Tool**: grep-like filtering with date/pattern matching
- **022 - Data Formatter**: Convert between CSV/JSON/table formats
- **023 - File Deduplicator**: Find duplicate files by content/name
- **024 - Configuration Merger**: Merge JSON/YAML with conflict resolution

### **Tier 3: Applications (030-039) - RUN**
**Scope**: Full applications with GUIs, APIs, persistence
**Duration**: 45-90 minutes per approach (180-360 min total parallel)
**Claude Code Usage**: ❌ **Requires >4 hours remaining**
**Purpose**: Study complex system architecture and integration
**Components Available**: Functions (Tier 1) + Tools (Tier 2) discoverable

#### Next Experiments
- **030 - Personal Knowledge Manager**: Note-taking with search and tagging
- **031 - Project Dashboard**: Development metrics and build monitoring
- **032 - Personal Finance Tracker**: Expense tracking with budgets and reports
- **033 - System Monitor**: Resource monitoring with alerts and history
- **034 - Document Processor**: Batch format conversion and workflow automation

## Discovered Components Research

### Key Innovation
Study **organic component discovery** patterns without explicit guidance:
- Components placed in `./utils/functions/` and `./utils/tools/`
- No mention in experiment prompts
- Natural exploration and reuse decisions measured
- Authentic development environment simulation

### Research Questions
1. **Discovery Patterns**: Which methodologies naturally explore existing codebases?
2. **Evaluation Criteria**: How do approaches assess found components for fitness?
3. **Integration Strategies**: What drives reuse vs. rebuild decisions?
4. **Architecture Influence**: How does component availability affect system design?

## Experimental Improvements

### Bias Prevention
- **Neutral naming enforced**: 1-immediate-implementation, 2-specification-driven, etc.
- **Language monitoring**: No quality indicators (naive/advanced/optimal)
- **Pre-experiment confirmation**: User validates bias-neutral setup
- **Post-experiment reporting**: Standard testing instructions with warnings

### Quality Improvements
- **Testing warnings**: Flag slow dependencies (pandas, heavy ML libs)
- **Quick test paths**: Always identify fast validation approach
- **Protocol compliance**: Transparent documentation of any violations
- **Reproducibility**: Clear instructions for result validation

## Priority Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Foundation (Next 2-3 months)
Execute experiments 010-014 to build function library and establish baseline methodology patterns.

### Phase 2: Tier 2 Composition (Following 2-3 months)
Execute experiments 020-024 to study tool composition and interface design with available function components.

### Phase 3: Tier 3 Integration (Final phase)
Execute experiments 030-034 to analyze complex system architecture with full component ecosystem.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Component reuse rates** across methodologies and tiers
- **Development speed** with and without available components
- **Quality metrics** (correctness, test coverage, maintainability)
- **Architecture complexity** measures

### Qualitative
- **Natural discovery patterns** for existing components
- **Integration strategy differences** between methodologies
- **Methodology consistency** across complexity tiers
- **Realistic development behavior** patterns

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Methodology Scaling**: How approaches adapt across complexity levels
2. **Component Utilization**: Which methodologies naturally leverage existing work
3. **Architecture Emergence**: What design patterns emerge from generative development
4. **Development Efficiency**: Cumulative benefits of building block availability

This tiered approach addresses the scope ambiguity problem while providing unprecedented insight into realistic development scenarios with existing codebases.
