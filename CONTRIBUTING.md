# Contributing to AI Development Methodology Research

## üåê **Open Research Mission**

This project provides a **complete experimental framework** for studying AI-assisted development methodologies. Our goal is to enable **distributed, independent research** that advances evidence-based understanding of effective AI development practices.

**Our Vision**: Empower researchers, teams, and communities worldwide to conduct rigorous methodology studies using our bias-prevention protocols and tiered experimental design.

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Your Own Research**

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI (or other AI development environment)
- Python 3.8+ (for most experiments, but framework supports any language)
- Git for version control
- Understanding of experimental bias and scientific methodology

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone [repository-url]
cd tdd-demo

# Explore the methodology
cat README.md
cat design/10_BIAS_PREVENTION_PROTOCOLS.md

# Run your first experiment
# In Claude Code, say: spawn-experiments
# Example: "Password generator with Python and cryptographic libraries"
```

## üî¨ **Research Approaches**

### **Option 1: Replicate Our Experiments**
**Goal**: Validate findings with different models, contexts, or implementations

**Value**: Strengthens scientific confidence in methodology differences

**Steps**:
1. Choose an experiment from `FUTURE_EXPERIMENTS_ROADMAP.md`
2. Follow `spawn-experiments` protocol exactly
3. Compare your results with any existing implementations
4. Share findings with your community using `SHARING_EXPERIMENTS_GUIDE.md`

### **Option 2: Extend to New Domains**
**Goal**: Study methodology patterns in your specific field

**Value**: Reveals domain-specific methodology effectiveness

**Examples**:
- **Frontend Development**: React components, CSS frameworks, responsive design
- **Data Science**: Analysis pipelines, model training, visualization tools
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure automation, monitoring, deployment strategies
- **Mobile Development**: Cross-platform frameworks, native optimizations

### **Option 3: Study Different Variables**
**Goal**: Investigate factors beyond our core methodology comparison

**Value**: Expands understanding of AI development effectiveness

**Research Questions**:
- **Model Differences**: How do different AI models respond to methodology guidance?
- **Experience Levels**: Do methodologies help novices vs experts differently?
- **Problem Complexity**: At what complexity do methodologies become critical?
- **Time Constraints**: How do methodologies perform under pressure?

### **Option 4: Build Domain-Specific Frameworks**
**Goal**: Adapt our framework for specialized research communities

**Value**: Enables field-specific methodology optimization

**Customizations**:
- **Academic Research**: Statistical rigor, peer review processes
- **Corporate Teams**: ROI analysis, productivity metrics
- **Open Source Projects**: Community coordination, contribution patterns
- **Educational Settings**: Learning outcomes, skill development

## üìä **Research Standards**

### **Bias Prevention (Critical)**
Always follow our bias prevention protocols:
- **Use neutral naming**: `1-immediate-implementation`, not `1-naive-approach`
- **Avoid quality indicators**: No words like "advanced", "better", "optimal"
- **Implement pre-experiment confirmation**: Validate bias-neutral setup
- **Document protocol compliance**: Note any deviations transparently

### **Experimental Rigor**
- **Control variables**: Keep everything identical except methodology
- **Session logging**: Capture development process with `script` command
- **Parallel execution**: Run all methodologies simultaneously when possible
- **Reproducible setup**: Document exact conditions for replication

### **Reporting Standards**
Follow our post-experiment checklist (design/13_POST_EXPERIMENT_CHECKLIST.md):
- **Testing instructions** with dependency warnings
- **Development process analysis** from session logs
- **Protocol compliance assessment**
- **Practical recommendations** for methodology selection

## ü§ù **Sharing Your Research**
