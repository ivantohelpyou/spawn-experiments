# Contributing to TDD in the AI Era - Methodology Research Project

## üß™ **Scientific Mission**

This project is a collaborative research effort to understand how different software development methodologies perform in the AI-assisted development era. We're scientists studying the evolution of programming practices, and we need **rigorous, comparable experimental data** to advance knowledge for the greater good.

**Our Goal**: Build a comprehensive dataset of methodology comparisons across different application types, enabling evidence-based recommendations for AI-assisted software development.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Python 3.8+ (most experiments use Python)
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of software development methodologies

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd tdd-demo

# Explore existing experiments
ls experiments/
cat META_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md
cat FUTURE_EXPERIMENTS_ROADMAP.md

# Try running an existing experiment report
cat experiments/009-multilingual-word-counter/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md
```

## üî¨ **How to Contribute**

### **Option 1: Run Existing Experiments (Validation Studies)**
Help validate our findings by replicating existing experiments:

1. **Choose an experiment** from `FUTURE_EXPERIMENTS_ROADMAP.md`
2. **Follow the spawn-experiments protocol** exactly as specified
3. **Document your results** using the standard report template
4. **Compare your findings** with previous results
5. **Submit via pull request** following safety guidelines below

### **Option 2: Design New Experiments (Original Research)**
Contribute original research with new application types:

1. **Review experimental standards** (see EXPERIMENTAL_STANDARDS.md)
2. **Propose your experiment** via GitHub issue first
3. **Get community feedback** on experimental design
4. **Execute with parallel launch approach**
5. **Submit comprehensive analysis** following report template

### **Option 3: Methodology Innovation (Advanced Research)**
Develop new development approaches or improve existing methods:

1. **Document your methodology thoroughly**
2. **Test against multiple application types**
3. **Provide comparative analysis** with existing 4-method framework
4. **Include test validation** if modifying TDD approaches

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety & Security Framework**

### **Core Principle**: Trust but Verify

We encourage open collaboration while protecting research integrity and repository security.

### **Safety Tiers**

#### **Tier 1: Experimental Code (Contributions Welcome)**
- **Location**: `experiments/` directory only
- **Review**: Basic safety review for malicious code
- **Execution**: Contributors run in isolated environments
- **Risk**: Low (isolated experimental code)

#### **Tier 2: Framework Code (Careful Review)**
- **Location**: `META_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md`, core documentation
- **Review**: Thorough review by maintainers
- **Testing**: Must not break existing experiment reproduction
- **Risk**: Medium (affects experiment consistency)

#### **Tier 3: Infrastructure Code (Restricted)**
- **Location**: CI/CD, repository automation
- **Review**: Maintainer approval required
- **Access**: Limited to trusted contributors
- **Risk**: High (could compromise repository security)

### **Contribution Safety Checklist**

**Before Submitting:**
- [ ] Code runs only in experimental directories
- [ ] No system-level operations (file system access limited to experiment folder)
- [ ] No network operations without explicit documentation
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Clear documentation of all external dependencies
- [ ] Experimental results are reproducible

**Red Flags (Automatic Rejection):**
- ‚ùå Code accessing parent directories (`../`)
- ‚ùå System administration commands (`sudo`, `chmod 777`, etc.)
- ‚ùå Network operations without clear justification
- ‚ùå Cryptocurrency mining or blockchain operations
- ‚ùå Code designed to consume excessive resources
- ‚ùå Attempts to modify core framework without discussion

## üìä **Experimental Design Standards**

### **Maintaining Comparable Results**

To ensure scientific validity, all experiments must follow these standards:

#### **Required Elements:**
1. **Identical Requirements**: All four methods receive the same application specification
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use Task tool for simultaneous launch when possible
3. **Time Measurement**: Record actual development time for each method
4. **Standard Metrics**: Lines of code, test coverage, feature completeness
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Follow established report template

#### **Technology Stack Guidelines:**
- **Primary**: Python (established baseline for comparison)
- **Secondary**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go (with community interest)
- **Experimental**: Other languages with clear justification

#### **Application Scope Rules:**
- **Bounded**: Clear, achievable requirements (not open-ended research)
- **Testable**: Results must be objectively measurable
- **Relevant**: Real-world applications with practical value
- **Scalable**: 10-25 minutes per method maximum

### **Report Quality Standards**

Every experiment contribution must include:

#### **Quantitative Data:**
- Development time for each method (precise timing)
- Lines of code produced
- Test coverage metrics
- Feature implementation completeness
- Error rates and bug counts

#### **Qualitative Analysis:**
- Methodology-specific observations
- Code quality assessment
- Architecture and design patterns
- Developer experience differences
- Unexpected findings or insights

#### **Comparative Context:**
- How results compare to similar experiments
- What this adds to overall research knowledge
- Implications for methodology selection
- Recommendations for different contexts

## üîÑ **Contribution Workflow**

### **For New Experiments:**

1. **Proposal Phase**
   ```bash
   # Create GitHub issue with experiment proposal
   # Include: application type, technology stack, expected scope
   # Wait for community feedback and maintainer approval
   ```

2. **Execution Phase**
   ```bash
   # Create new branch for your experiment
   git checkout -b experiment/010-your-experiment-name
