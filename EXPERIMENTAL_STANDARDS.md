# Experimental Design Standards for TDD Methodology Research

## üî¨ **Scientific Methodology Requirements**

This document establishes rigorous standards for conducting comparable, reproducible experiments in software development methodology research. These standards ensure scientific validity and meaningful cross-experiment analysis.

## üìã **Experimental Protocol**

### **1. Hypothesis Formation**

Every experiment must begin with a clear, testable hypothesis:

**Template:**
```
Hypothesis: [Methodology X] will produce [specific measurable outcome]
compared to [baseline methodologies] when implementing [application type]
because [theoretical reasoning].

Example: "Enhanced TDD with test validation will produce fewer bugs and
higher confidence scores compared to direct implementation when building
data processing applications because the test validation step catches
implementation errors before they propagate."
```

**Required Elements:**
- Specific methodology comparison
- Measurable outcomes
- Clear application domain
- Theoretical justification

### **2. Experimental Design**

#### **Control Variables (Must Be Identical)**
- **Application Requirements**: Exact same functional specifications
- **Technology Stack**: Same programming language, libraries, frameworks
- **Development Environment**: Same AI assistant, same Claude Code version
- **Time Window**: Same session, parallel execution when possible
- **Success Criteria**: Identical definition of "completion"

#### **Independent Variables (Methodologies)**
1. **Method 1: Direct Implementation**
   - Build immediately without formal planning
   - Focus on working solution as quickly as possible

2. **Method 2: Specification-First Implementation**
   - Write comprehensive specifications first
   - Then implement according to specifications

3. **Method 3: Test-Driven Development**
   - Follow strict Red-Green-Refactor cycles
   - Write failing tests before implementation

4. **Method 4: Enhanced TDD with Test Validation**
   - TDD plus test validation step
   - Prove tests catch intended errors before implementation

#### **Dependent Variables (Measurements)**

**Quantitative Metrics (Required):**
- Development time (minutes and seconds)
- Lines of code produced
- Number of tests written
- Test coverage percentage (when applicable)
- Number of bugs/errors encountered during development
- Number of refactoring cycles

**Qualitative Metrics (Required):**
- Code organization quality (subjective 1-5 scale)
- Documentation completeness (subjective 1-5 scale)
- Maintainability assessment (subjective 1-5 scale)
- Developer confidence in correctness (subjective 1-5 scale)

### **3. Application Selection Criteria**

#### **Scope Requirements**
- **Bounded**: Clear, finite requirements (not open-ended)
- **Implementable**: 10-25 minutes per method maximum
- **Testable**: Objective success criteria
- **Realistic**: Mirrors real-world development tasks

#### **Complexity Guidelines**
- **Trivial** (5-10 min): Hello world variations, simple calculators
- **Simple** (10-15 min): CRUD operations, basic algorithms
- **Moderate** (15-20 min): Multi-feature applications, API integrations
- **Complex** (20-25 min): Multi-component systems, advanced features
- **Too Complex** (>25 min): Should be split into multiple experiments

#### **Domain Coverage**
Ensure experiments cover diverse application domains:
- **Mathematical/Algorithmic**: Expression evaluators, sorting algorithms
- **Data Processing**: File processors, data transformers
- **User Interfaces**: CLI tools, web interfaces, GUIs
- **Integration**: APIs, databases, external services
- **System-Level**: File systems, networking, concurrent processing

## üéØ **Execution Standards**

### **Parallel Execution Protocol (Recommended)**

**Setup Phase:**
```bash
# Create numbered experiment directory
mkdir experiments/[NNN]-[descriptive-name]
cd experiments/[NNN]-[descriptive-name]

# Create method subdirectories
mkdir 1-naive-approach 2-spec-first 3-tdd-approach 4-enhanced-tdd

# Create README files with prompts
```

**Launch Phase:**
```bash
# Single message with four Task tool calls for simultaneous execution
Task(...) # Method 1
Task(...) # Method 2
Task(...) # Method 3
Task(...) # Method 4
```

**Monitoring Phase:**
- Record start time for each method
- Monitor progress without interference
- Document any unexpected behaviors or issues
- Record completion time for each method

### **Data Collection Requirements**

#### **Timing Data (Precise)**
```
Start Time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Method 1 Complete: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (Duration: X minutes Y seconds)
Method 2 Complete: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (Duration: X minutes Y seconds)
Method 3 Complete: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (Duration: X minutes Y seconds)
Method 4 Complete: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (Duration: X minutes Y seconds)
Analysis Complete: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
```

#### **Code Metrics (Automated When Possible)**
```bash
# Lines of code
find . -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} +

# File count
find . -name "*.py" | wc -l

# Test count (if applicable)
grep -r "def test_" . | wc -l
```

#### **Functional Completeness**
- [ ] All core requirements implemented
- [ ] Edge cases handled appropriately
- [ ] Error handling present

## üìä **Analysis Standards**

### **Statistical Considerations**

#### **Sample Size**
- **Single Experiments**: Valuable for exploratory research
- **Replicated Experiments**: Multiple runs of same application type
- **Meta-Analysis**: Cross-experiment pattern identification

#### **Bias Mitigation**
- **Randomization**: When possible, randomize method assignment
- **Blinding**: Analyze code without knowing which method produced it
- **Control Groups**: Compare against previous similar experiments
- **Documentation**: Record all decisions and potential bias sources

#### **Significance Testing**
- **Quantitative Differences**: Note percentage differences in metrics
- **Qualitative Patterns**: Identify recurring themes across methods
- **Statistical Significance**: Consider power analysis for replicated experiments
