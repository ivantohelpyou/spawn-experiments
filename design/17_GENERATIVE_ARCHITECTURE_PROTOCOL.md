# Generative Architecture Protocol

## Problem Statement

Traditional software experiments compare methodologies in sterile, isolated environments, missing the critical question: **How do methodologies perform in realistic development scenarios with existing codebases?**

Real software development involves:
- Discovering and evaluating existing components
- Making reuse vs. rebuild decisions
- Integrating with legacy systems and utilities
- Building incrementally on previous work

## Solution: Discovered Components Experimentation

### Core Innovation
**Study methodologies in environments with discoverable components without explicitly directing attention to them**, enabling analysis of:
- Natural component discovery patterns
- Organic integration decision-making
- Realistic architectural choices
- Authentic development behavior

## Three-Tier Architecture

### Tier 1: Functions (Crawl)
**Scope**: Pure algorithms, single functions, stdlib only
**Output**: Reusable function libraries
**Examples**: `is_palindrome()`, `count_words()`, `merge_intervals()`

### Tier 2: Tools (Walk)
**Scope**: CLI utilities, file processing, composable tools
**Output**: Command-line tools that can import Tier 1 functions
**Examples**: `textstats`, `logparse`, `dedup` (using Tier 1 algorithms)

### Tier 3: Applications (Run)
**Scope**: Full applications with GUIs, APIs, persistence
**Output**: Complete systems that can integrate Tier 1 functions and Tier 2 tools
**Examples**: Knowledge manager, project dashboard, finance tracker

## Isolated Component Environments

### Component Curation Strategy
- **Tier 1 outputs** → `component_library/functions/` (centralized storage)
- **Tier 2 outputs** → `component_library/tools/` (centralized storage)
- **Per-experiment curation** → Select relevant components only
- **Physical isolation** → Copy components into individual trial directories

### Trial Environment Structure

### Organic Discovery Process
```python
# Agents discover components through natural exploration:
# From DEVELOPMENT_SESSION.log:
[14:23:05] $ ls utils/
[14:23:06] functions  README.md
[14:23:07] $ cat utils/functions/text_processor.py
[14:23:10] $ python -c "from utils.functions.text_processor import normalize; print(normalize('test'))"

# Agents may choose to:
# - Import and use: from utils.functions.text_processor import normalize
# - Copy and modify: cp utils/functions/text_processor.py my_processor.py
# - Build from scratch: Ignore discovered components entirely
```

### Authentic Development Environment
Each tier operates in realistic conditions:
- **Tier 1**: Clean algorithmic challenges
- **Tier 2**: CLI tools with potential function reuse opportunities
- **Tier 3**: Applications with rich component ecosystem available

### Natural Behavioral Study
Measure organic methodology patterns:
1. **Exploration Behavior**: Do approaches naturally investigate existing codebases?
2. **Evaluation Criteria**: How do methodologies assess discovered components?
3. **Integration Decisions**: What drives reuse vs. rebuild choices?
4. **Architectural Adaptation**: How does component discovery influence system design?

## Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Baseline (Functions)
Run 4 methodologies on function-level problems in clean environment:
- Establish pure methodology characteristics
- Create component library in `./utils/functions/`
- No existing components available for discovery

### Phase 2: Tier 2 Composition (Tools)
Run 4 methodologies on tool-level problems with curated Tier 1 components:
- **Environment**: Relevant Tier 1 functions copied to each trial's `utils/` directory
- **Curation**: Select functions relevant to tool development (file I/O, text processing, etc.)
- **Measurement**: Component discovery, evaluation, and integration patterns
- **Analysis**: How methodologies leverage existing functions for tool construction

### Phase 3: Tier 3 Integration (Applications)
Run 4 methodologies on application-level problems with full curated ecosystem:
- **Environment**: Relevant Tier 1 functions + Tier 2 tools copied to each trial's `utils/`
- **Curation**: Select components relevant to application domain
- **Measurement**: Multi-tier component utilization and system composition
- **Analysis**: Complex architecture decisions with rich component availability

## Implementation Protocol

### Experiment Setup (Clean Approach)
```markdown
"You are implementing [Tier N problem].

[Standard problem specification with no mention of existing components]

Build the best solution using your assigned methodology."
```

**Key Principle**: No explicit mention of available components. Natural discovery only.

### Component Documentation
Each experiment produces:
- **Component Registry**: Clear import paths and usage examples

- **Quality Comparison**: Component reuse impact on solution quality
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Development time and effort comparisons

## Validation Framework

### Component Quality Gates
- **Tier 1**: Functions must be importable and well-tested
- **Tier 2**: Tools must have clear CLI interfaces and documentation
- **Tier 3**: Applications must successfully integrate multiple components

### Integration Testing

## Conclusion

Discovered components experimentation provides authentic insight into how development methodologies perform in realistic environments with existing codebases, without the artificial bias of explicitly directing attention to available components.

**Key Innovation**: By studying methodologies in environments with organically discoverable components, we can understand natural exploration patterns, evaluation criteria, and integration decisions that reflect real-world development behavior.

**Research Value**: Results will reveal which methodologies naturally leverage existing work, how they make reuse decisions, and what architectural patterns emerge when components are available but not prescribed.

**Authenticity Advantage**: This approach preserves experimental validity while studying realistic development scenarios, providing insights into genuine methodology behavior rather than responses to experimental artifacts.
