# Resource-Constrained Experiment Design

**Purpose**: Address the challenge of running fair methodology comparisons when AI agents face token limits, tool usage constraints, or other resource limitations.

**Context**: Experiment 007 revealed that TDD methodologies require significantly more tool interactions (54 vs 29), causing Methods 3 & 4 to hit token limits while Methods 1 & 2 completed successfully. This creates bias in methodology comparison.

## Problem Statement

### Resource Consumption Patterns
- **Direct Implementation**: Low tool usage, single-pass approach
- **Specification-First**: Moderate tool usage, two-phase approach
- **TDD Approaches**: High tool usage due to red-green-refactor cycles
- **Enhanced TDD**: Very high tool usage due to validation steps

### Bias Sources
1. **Temporal Bias**: Methods launched later may inherit resource debt from earlier methods
2. **Complexity Bias**: More sophisticated methodologies inherently require more resources
3. **Completion Bias**: Incomplete implementations appear inferior regardless of methodology quality
4. **Resource Allocation Bias**: Early methods get full allocation, later methods get remainder

## Design Strategies

### Strategy 1: Sequential Execution with Fresh Resources

**Approach**: Run each method in completely separate sessions with full resource allocation.

**Implementation**:
```
Session 1: Method 1 (Direct) - Full resources
Session 2: Method 2 (Spec-First) - Full resources
Session 3: Method 3 (TDD) - Full resources
Session 4: Method 4 (Enhanced TDD) - Full resources
```

**Advantages**:
- Fair resource allocation
- No resource debt between methods
- True methodology comparison

**Disadvantages**:
- Cannot demonstrate parallel development
- Requires multiple session management
- Loses timing comparison value

### Strategy 2: Resource-Aware Parallel Execution

**Approach**: Launch methods in resource-optimal order with monitoring.

**Implementation**:
```
Phase 1: Launch most resource-intensive methods first
- Method 4 (Enhanced TDD) - Highest expected usage
- Method 3 (TDD) - High expected usage

Phase 2: Launch moderate resource methods
- Method 2 (Spec-First) - Medium expected usage
- Method 1 (Direct) - Lowest expected usage
```

**Advantages**:
- Maintains parallel development demonstration
- Prioritizes resource-hungry methods
- Single session management

**Disadvantages**:
- Still risks resource exhaustion
- May create artificial time pressure
- Difficult to predict exact resource needs

### Strategy 3: Incremental Resource Allocation

**Approach**: Pre-allocate specific resource budgets to each method.

**Implementation**:
```
Method 1: 25% of total resources (simple approach)
Method 2: 30% of total resources (specification phase)
Method 3: 35% of total resources (iterative TDD)
Method 4: 40% of total resources (validation overhead)
```

**Note**: Percentages exceed 100% intentionally - methods typically don't use full allocation.

**Advantages**:
- Explicit resource management
- Methods can't exhaust shared pool
- Predictable resource distribution

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires resource monitoring capability
- May artificially limit high-performing methods
- Complex to implement without native tooling

### Strategy 4: Checkpoint-Based Execution

**Approach**: Run methods to specific checkpoints, then evaluate partial results.

**Implementation**:
```
Checkpoint 1: Specifications complete (all methods)
Checkpoint 2: Basic functionality working (all methods)
Checkpoint 3: Full feature set complete (as resources allow)
Checkpoint 4: Testing and documentation complete (as resources allow)
```

**Advantages**:
- Fair comparison at each checkpoint
- Can assess methodology effectiveness at different stages
- Graceful degradation under resource constraints

**Disadvantages**:
- Artificial stopping points may not align with methodology
- Complex coordination required
- May favor methods that front-load deliverables

### Strategy 5: Resource Pool Management

**Approach**: Create separate resource pools for different experiment phases.

**Implementation**:
```
Pool A: Specification/Planning Phase
- All methods get equal allocation for planning
- Prevents early resource exhaustion

Pool B: Implementation Phase
- Separate allocation for actual coding
- Methods compete fairly for implementation resources

Pool C: Testing/Documentation Phase
- Final allocation for quality assurance
- Ensures all methods can complete basic testing
```

**Advantages**:
- Phase-appropriate resource allocation
- Prevents any single phase from consuming all resources
- More granular resource management

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires sophisticated resource tracking
- May not align with methodology natural flow
- Complex implementation

## Hybrid Approach Recommendation

### Two-Tier Experiment Design

**Tier 1: Parallel Resource-Aware Execution**
- Launch methods in resource-optimal order
- Monitor for resource constraints
- Capture partial results if limits hit

**Tier 2: Sequential Completion (if needed)**
- If any method hits limits in Tier 1, re-run in fresh session
- Compare both constrained and unconstrained results
- Document resource impact on methodology effectiveness

### Implementation Steps

1. **Pre-Experiment Assessment**:
   - Estimate resource requirements based on methodology complexity
   - Determine optimal launch order
   - Set monitoring checkpoints

2. **Parallel Execution with Monitoring**:
   - Launch in resource-optimal order
   - Capture metrics at regular intervals
   - Stop gracefully if limits approached

3. **Resource Impact Analysis**:
   - Compare completed vs. constrained implementations
   - Analyze resource efficiency by methodology
   - Document resource-quality tradeoffs

4. **Sequential Completion (if needed)**:
   - Re-run constrained methods in fresh sessions
   - Compare constrained vs. unconstrained results
   - Assess true methodology effectiveness

## Success Metrics

### Resource Efficiency Metrics
- **Tools per Feature**: Tool usage normalized by features implemented
- **Tokens per Line of Code**: Resource efficiency of code generation
- **Time to First Working Version**: Speed under resource constraints
- **Graceful Degradation**: Quality maintenance under resource pressure

### Methodology Resilience Metrics
- **Core Feature Completion Rate**: Essential features implemented despite constraints
- **Quality Under Pressure**: Code quality when resources limited
- **Resource Predictability**: How well methodology resource needs can be estimated

## Implementation Considerations

### For Controlling Agent
- Monitor resource usage across all parallel agents
- Implement graceful shutdown before hard limits
- Capture partial results for incomplete methods
- Provide resource usage feedback to experiment analysis

### For Method Agents
- No changes to agent prompts (maintain experiment purity)
- Natural methodology implementation without resource awareness
- Let resource constraints emerge organically from methodology choice

### For Analysis Phase
- Compare like-for-like where possible
- Separate resource-constrained from unconstrained analysis
- Document resource impact as methodology characteristic
- Provide recommendations for resource planning

## Future Research Directions

1. **Resource Prediction Models**: Develop models to predict resource needs by methodology
2. **Adaptive Resource Allocation**: Dynamic resource reallocation based on method progress
3. **Resource-Methodology Optimization**: Design methodologies optimized for resource constraints
4. **Multi-Session Experiment Frameworks**: Tools for managing experiments across multiple sessions

## Conclusion

Resource constraints are a real-world factor that affects methodology comparison. Rather than viewing them as experimental flaws, they should be considered as part of the methodology evaluation. Some methodologies are inherently more resource-intensive, and this characteristic should be factored into adoption decisions.

The hybrid approach balances experimental purity (parallel execution) with fairness (sequential completion when needed), providing both realistic resource-constrained results and idealized unconstrained comparison.
