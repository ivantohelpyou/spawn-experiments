### Multi-Tier Building Blocks
Applications explicitly leverage previous tier implementations:
```python
# Tier 1 functions
from experiments.016_word_counter import count_words
from experiments.012_anagram_grouper import group_anagrams

# Tier 2 tools
from experiments.020_textstats import TextStatsEngine
from experiments.021_logparse import LogParseCore
```
