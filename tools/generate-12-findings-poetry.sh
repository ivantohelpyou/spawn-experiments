# 12 Findings Poetry Showcase
## All Research Findings as Poetry

Each of the 12 validated findings from spawn-experiments converted into 3 poetry formats:
- ðŸŽ‹ **Haiku** (5-7-5 syllables)
- ðŸ“œ **Iambic Pentameter** (10 syllables/line)
- ðŸŽª **Limerick** (AABBA rhyme scheme)

All outputs are **gold medal winners** (Method 2: Specification-Driven).
