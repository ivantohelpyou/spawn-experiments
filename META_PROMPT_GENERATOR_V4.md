## ðŸ”¬ Core Experimental Framework

### **Step 0: Baseline Specification Generation**

```
BASELINE SPECIFICATION PROTOCOL:

1. Generate reasonable scope specification for [APPLICATION_TYPE]
2. Present to experimenter for approval/editing
3. Use approved baseline as shared foundation for all methods
4. Optional: Create specification variants (minimal/standard/detailed)

SPECIFICATION FORMAT:
- Core functionality requirements
- Key constraints and boundaries
- Expected input/output behavior
- Essential edge cases to handle
- Explicit exclusions (what NOT to build)

EXPERIMENTER DECISION POINT:
- Approve as-is
- Edit scope up/down
- Create multiple baselines for comparison
```

### **Branch Isolation Protocol** (Add to ALL prompts)

```
IMPORTANT: Create a dedicated branch for your experiment:

git checkout -b exp-[EXPERIMENT_NUMBER]-[METHOD_NAME]

Examples:
- git checkout -b exp-1504-immediate
- git checkout -b exp-1504-specification
- git checkout -b exp-1504-tdd
- git checkout -b exp-1504-validated

This enables:
- Clean experiment isolation
- Main branch protection
- Easy comparison between methods
- Clean integration when complete
```

### **Atomic Commit Protocol** (Add to ALL prompts)

```
IMPORTANT: Checkpoint your progress with atomic git commits:

After each meaningful step, commit your work:
- git add -A && git commit -m "Specs: [what you defined]"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Impl: [what you built]"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Test: [what you tested]"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Fix: [what you fixed]"
- git add -A && git commit -m "COMPLETE: [solution summary]"

Commit at least every 3 minutes or at major milestones.
This enables progress tracking and clean integration back to main.
```

### **Integration Protocol**

```
EXPERIMENT COMPLETION:

1. Complete work on feature branch
2. Create comprehensive experiment report
3. Merge back to main with clean summary commit
4. Keep branches for historical analysis

git checkout main
git merge --no-ff exp-[EXPERIMENT_NUMBER]-[METHOD_NAME]
git commit -m "Complete: [EXPERIMENT_NUMBER] [METHOD_NAME] methodology"
```

cd /home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments
# Say "spawn-experiments" to Claude
# Provide APPLICATION_TYPE and TECH_STACK
# Review and approve generated baseline
# Launch four parallel method executions
