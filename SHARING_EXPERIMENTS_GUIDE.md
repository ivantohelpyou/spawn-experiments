# Sharing Your Experimental Results: Presentation Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you present your TDD methodology experiments to technical groups, meetups, conferences, or teams. Whether you've replicated our experiments or created your own, these approaches make the research accessible and engaging.

## Presentation Formats

### **Format 1: Live Coding Demonstration**
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Audience**: Developer meetups, conference talks
**Approach**: Live comparison of methodologies

#### Structure
1. **Setup (5 mins)**: Explain the research question - "Does methodology guidance matter for AI development?"
2. **Method Overview (10 mins)**: Briefly introduce the four approaches without bias language
3. **Live Experiment (20 mins)**: Run `spawn-experiments` and execute 2-3 approaches live
4. **Results Analysis (10 mins)**: Compare code quality, architecture, testing approaches

#### Pro Tips
- **Choose simple problems** for live demos (Tier 1 function-level works best)
- **Pre-run experiments** so you have backup results if live demo fails
- **Focus on process differences** rather than just final code
- **Show session logs** to reveal methodology patterns

### **Format 2: Research Results Presentation**
**Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**Audience**: Technical teams, research groups
**Approach**: Present completed experimental findings

#### Structure
1. **Research Question (5 mins)**: Why study AI development methodologies?
2. **Experimental Design (5 mins)**: Bias prevention, tier system, discovered components
3. **Key Findings (15 mins)**: Show concrete differences across your experiments
4. **Implications (5 mins)**: When to use different approaches

#### Evidence to Present
- **Session log excerpts** showing discovery patterns
- **Architecture comparisons** across methodologies
- **Component reuse patterns** (if using Tier 2-3)
- **Development time and quality metrics**

### **Format 3: Workshop Format**
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Audience**: Teams wanting hands-on experience
**Approach**: Participants run their own experiments

#### Structure
1. **Framework Introduction (30 mins)**: Research methodology and bias prevention
2. **Hands-on Experimentation (90 mins)**: Groups run spawn-experiments on different problems
3. **Results Sharing (30 mins)**: Groups present their findings
4. **Discussion (30 mins)**: Implications for their work

#### Materials Needed
- **Pre-selected problems** from Tier 1 experiment list
- **Bias prevention checklist** for each group
- **Results template** for consistent reporting

## Key Messages to Emphasize

### **1. Scientific Approach**
- **Bias prevention is crucial** - show how language affects results
- **Reproducible methodology** - others can replicate and extend
- **Evidence-based conclusions** - let data speak, not opinions

### **2. Practical Implications**
- **Different methodologies excel in different contexts**
- **Component discovery varies significantly** across approaches
- **Architecture emergence** is methodology-dependent
- **Development team training** should consider these patterns

### **3. Open Research**
- **Framework is freely available** for replication
- **Community-driven discovery** - no gatekeeping
- **Extensible to new domains** and problems
- **Academic and industry applications**

## Presentation Materials You Can Create

### **Slide Deck Template**
```markdown
1. Title: "AI Development Methodology Research: Evidence-Based Comparison"
2. The Question: "Does how you prompt AI matter as much as what you prompt for?"
3. Research Approach: Bias prevention, tier system, session logging
4. Live Demo / Results (choose based on format)
5. Key Findings: [Your specific discoveries]
6. When to Use Each Approach
7. Try It Yourself: spawn-experiments walkthrough
8. Open Research: Community extension opportunities
```

### **Code Examples to Show**
- **Same problem, different solutions** from your experiments
- **Session log excerpts** showing discovery patterns
- **Architecture evolution** across complexity tiers
- **Testing strategy differences** between methodologies

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Live spawn-experiments** demonstration
- **Audience prediction** of which approach will work best
- **Real-time methodology voting** during live coding
- **Q&A about specific findings** from your experiments
