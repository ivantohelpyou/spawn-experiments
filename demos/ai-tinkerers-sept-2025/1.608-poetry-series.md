# Command-Line Prompt: Poetry Form Converter Experiments

## Experiment Series: 1.608.A, 1.608.B, 1.608.C

Single-command prompts for running complete experiments with no manual intervention.

---

## 1.608.A - Iambic Pentameter Converter

```bash
claude "Run Experiment 1.608.A - Iambic Pentameter Converter on PRIVATE branch.

TASK: Build a story-to-iambic-pentameter converter that converts prose into Shakespearean verse (10 syllables, alternating unstressed/stressed). Use llama3.2 via Ollama. Include Olympic judging system (3 LLM judges score each output).

Use META_PROMPT_GENERATOR_V4.md with these methods:
1. Immediate Implementation
2. Specification-Driven
3. Pure TDD
4. Adaptive/Validated TDD

Use optimized prompts (lessons from 1.608 Run 4).

DELIVERABLES:
- 4 complete implementations with tests
- Olympic judging script: olympic_judging_demo.py --run 1 --methods 4
  (3 LLM judges, drop high/low, average remaining scores)
- CLI tool: tools/generate-iambic \"Your story\" --run 1 --top 3
  (runs top N implementations, shows ranked results with medals)
- Code quality report
- EXPERIMENT_1608A_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md

EXECUTE COMPLETELY: Run all 4 methods in parallel, build CLI tool, test with sample story, generate final report. Commit to private-main when complete.

DO NOT STOP for confirmations. Execute the entire experiment end-to-end."
```

## 1.608.B - Limerick Converter

```bash
claude "Run Experiment 1.608.B - Limerick Converter on PRIVATE branch.

TASK: Build a story-to-limerick converter that converts prose into limericks (AABBA rhyme scheme, specific meter). Use llama3.2 via Ollama. Include Olympic judging system (3 LLM judges score each output).

Use META_PROMPT_GENERATOR_V4.md with these methods:
1. Immediate Implementation
2. Specification-Driven
3. Pure TDD
4. Adaptive/Validated TDD

Use optimized prompts (lessons from 1.608 Run 4).

DELIVERABLES:
- 4 complete implementations with tests
- Olympic judging script: olympic_judging_demo.py --run 1 --methods 4
  (3 LLM judges, drop high/low, average remaining scores)
- CLI tool: tools/generate-limerick \"Your story\" --run 1 --top 3
  (runs top N implementations, shows ranked results with medals)
- Code quality report
- EXPERIMENT_1608B_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md

EXECUTE COMPLETELY: Run all 4 methods in parallel, build CLI tool, test with sample story, generate final report. Commit to private-main when complete.

DO NOT STOP for confirmations. Execute the entire experiment end-to-end."
```

## 1.608.C - Terza Rima Converter

```bash
claude "Run Experiment 1.608.C - Terza Rima Converter on PRIVATE branch.

TASK: Build a story-to-terza-rima converter that converts prose into Dante's interlocking tercets (ABA BCB CDC pattern). Use llama3.2 via Ollama. Include Olympic judging system (3 LLM judges score each output).

Use META_PROMPT_GENERATOR_V4.md with these methods:
1. Immediate Implementation
2. Specification-Driven
3. Pure TDD
4. Adaptive/Validated TDD

Use optimized prompts (lessons from 1.608 Run 4).

  (runs top N implementations, shows ranked results with medals)
- Code quality report
- EXPERIMENT_1608C_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md

EXECUTE COMPLETELY: Run all 4 methods in parallel, build CLI tool, test with sample story, generate final report. Commit to private-main when complete.

DO NOT STOP for confirmations. Execute the entire experiment end-to-end."

## Demo Script

For live demonstration at AI Tinkerers:

```bash
# Show the prompt
cat prompts/1.608-series-poetry-forms.md

# Run experiment (example: Limerick)
claude "Run Experiment 1.608.B - Limerick Converter on PRIVATE branch..."

# While it runs (parallel), show:
# 1. The META_PROMPT_GENERATOR_V4.md methodology
# 2. Previous 1.608 haiku results
# 3. Architecture of Olympic judging system

# When complete, demo the CLI tool:
cd experiments/1.608.B-limerick-converter
tools/generate-limerick "In a small village, an old woman tended her garden every day. One morning, she found a mysterious seed that glowed faintly in the dawn light."

# Show ranked results (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
# Explain methodology differences in outputs
```

## Key Features for No-Stop Demo

1. **Single command execution** - No manual intervention needed
2. **Explicit branch target** - Always private-main
3. **Complete deliverables** - CLI tool, tests, reports all generated
4. **Auto-commit** - Commits when done
5. **Optimized prompts** - Uses lessons from 1.608 Run 4
6. **Parallel execution** - All 4 methods run simultaneously

---

## Post-Demo Cleanup

After demonstrating all 3 experiments:

```bash
# Clean up build artifacts
./scripts/post-experiment-cleanup.sh

# Optional: Compare all 3 poetry forms
cd experiments
grep -r "Code Quality Score" 1.608*/EXPERIMENT_*.md
```

---

## Success Criteria

Each experiment should complete in ~15-20 minutes and produce:

✅ 4 working implementations
✅ Comprehensive test suites
✅ Olympic judging system (3 judges)
✅ CLI tool with ranked output
✅ Code quality analysis
✅ Complete summary report

Total demo time: ~60-75 minutes for all 3 experiments
