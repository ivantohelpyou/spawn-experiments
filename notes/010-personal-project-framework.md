# 010 - Personal Project Framework - Alpha Prefix System

**Date**: September 21, 2025

**Context**: Extending spawn-experiments framework for personal/client project development

## Core Concept

Use the spawn-experiments methodology framework as a **personal development system** - leveraging the proven 4-method approach to build my own toolkit of reusable components while maintaining clear separation from public research.

## Numbering System Revision

### **Public Research (Numeric - For Release)**
```
1.XXX - Tier 1 Functions (public research)
2.XXX - Tier 2 CLI Tools (public research)
3.XXX - Tier 3 Applications (public research)
4.XXX - Special Studies (methodology research)
```

### **Personal Projects (Alpha Prefixes - Private Only)**
```
P.XXX - Personal Functions (Ivan's utility functions)
T.XXX - Personal Tools (Ivan's CLI tools)
A.XXX - Personal Applications (Ivan's full apps)
C.XXX - Client Projects (business work)
X.XXX - Experimental/Prototype Projects
```

## Strategic Value

### **Personal Toolkit Development**

## Component Discovery Strategy

### **Natural Reuse Hierarchy**
1. **Personal functions (P.XXX)** discover and reuse **public research (1.XXX)**
2. **Personal tools (T.XXX)** discover and reuse both **P.XXX** and **public tools (2.XXX)**
3. **Personal apps (A.XXX)** discover entire ecosystem
4. **Client projects (C.XXX)** leverage complete personal toolkit

### **Discovery Research Questions**
- **Which methodologies naturally discover personal components?**
- **Do personal projects reuse differently than research projects?**
- **How does business pressure affect component vs. rebuild decisions?**
- **What's the optimal personal component library size?**
