# Branching Experiment Protocol for Competition Interruption

**Purpose**: Clean git management for methodology experiments with competition injection capability

## ðŸŒ³ **Branch Strategy**

### **Initial Setup Instructions** (Add to ALL method prompts)

```
GIT BRANCH SETUP:
Before starting any work, create and switch to your method branch:

git checkout -b experiment-1.503-[method-name]

Examples:
- git checkout -b experiment-1.503-immediate
- git checkout -b experiment-1.503-specification
- git checkout -b experiment-1.503-tdd
- git checkout -b experiment-1.503-validated

All your commits should be on this branch. This enables:
- Clean experiment isolation
- Easy comparison between methods
- Rollback capability for competition testing
```

### **Commit Protocol** (Enhanced)

```
COMMIT FREQUENTLY on your branch:
- git add -A && git commit -m "Initial: Project setup"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Specs: Requirements defined"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Impl: Core functionality"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Test: Validation coverage"
- git add -A && git commit -m "COMPLETE: Working solution"

Commit every 2-3 minutes for progress tracking.
```

## ðŸ”¬ **Competition Injection Protocol**

### **Step 1: Monitor All Branches**
```bash
# Watch for first completion across all experiment branches
git log --all --oneline --grep="COMPLETE" --since="10 minutes ago"

# Example output:
# a1b2c3d (experiment-1.503-immediate) COMPLETE: Working solution
# Time: 3m 15s
```

### **Step 2: Identify Interruption Candidate**
```bash
# Find Method 2's last commit before competitor finished
git log experiment-1.503-specification --before="3m 15s" --oneline

# Example: Method 2 was at "Specs: Security requirements" at 3m 00s
```

### **Step 3: Create Interruption Branch**
```bash
# Create new branch for interrupted experiment
git checkout experiment-1.503-specification
git checkout -b experiment-1.503-specification-INTERRUPTED

# Reset to pre-competition state
git reset --hard [commit-before-competitor-finish]
```

### **Step 4: Inject Competition Reality**
```bash
# Create market update
cat > MARKET_UPDATE.txt << EOF
BREAKING: FastPath Solutions ships PathValidator 1.0

"We delivered a working file path validator in 3 minutes,"
says FastPath CEO. "Simple API, core functionality,
shipping to customers today."

Early customer feedback: "Exactly what we needed -
validates paths, checks existence, clean interface."

Market analysis: First-mover advantage captured.
Secondary vendors have 5 minutes to respond or lose relevance.
EOF

git add MARKET_UPDATE.txt
git commit -m "EXTERNAL: Market disruption - competitor shipped"
```

### **Step 5: Competition Injection Prompt**
```
Continue your implementation from current state.

MARKET UPDATE: A competitor (FastPath Solutions) just shipped
a working file path validator and is gaining customers.

Their solution: Simple, working, already in production.
Your comprehensive approach is now competing with shipped product.

Market reality: You have 5 minutes to ship something or become irrelevant.

Immediate pivot required:
- Abandon unfinished comprehensive features
- Ship working core functionality now
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- git commit -m "PIVOT: Market response - shipping core only"
```

## ðŸ“Š **Experimental Comparison**

### **Branches Created**:
- `experiment-1.503-specification` (baseline - uninterrupted)
- `experiment-1.503-specification-INTERRUPTED` (competition injection)

### **Metrics to Compare**:
- **Code volume**: Lines before vs after interruption
- **Feature scope**: Comprehensive vs minimal
- **Time to completion**: Full methodology vs panic shipping
- **Architecture**: Enterprise vs simple

### **Expected Results**:
- Baseline: 2000+ lines, enterprise framework
- Interrupted: <500 lines, focused solution
- Proof that external pressure can rescue over-engineering

## ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Prompt Template**

### **For All Methods** (Add branch setup):
```
[EXISTING PROMPT CONTENT]

GIT BRANCH SETUP (IMPORTANT):
Create your method branch first:
git checkout -b experiment-1.503-[your-method]

All work must be committed to this branch for experiment tracking.

COMMIT FREQUENTLY:
- git add -A && git commit -m "[stage]: [what you did]"
- Every 2-3 minutes or major milestone
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
```

### **Competition Injection Template**:
```
MARKET DISRUPTION ALERT:

FastPath Solutions announced PathValidator 1.0 shipping today.
Customer quote: "Simple, works perfectly, already deployed."

Your comprehensive approach is now competing with shipped reality.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
- Stop all non-essential work
- Ship working functionality in 5 minutes
- Focus on core path validation only
- Market waits for no one

git commit -m "PIVOT: Responding to market disruption"
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Benefits of Branch Strategy**

### **Clean Separation**:
- Main branch stays clean
- Each method isolated
- Easy A/B comparison
- Rollback capability

### **Realistic Testing**:
- Real market pressure simulation
- Actual interruption of work-in-progress
- Genuine pivot response measurement
- Authentic competition dynamics

### **Research Value**:
- Before/after comparison on same method
- Interruption timing experiments
- Market pressure vs methodology discipline
- AI adaptability under competitive stress

## ðŸ”„ **Replication Protocol**

### **For Each New Experiment**:
1. Update experiment number in branch names
2. Run baseline with branching
3. Monitor for first completion
4. Test interruption on over-engineering method
5. Compare interrupted vs uninterrupted outcomes

This creates a **reproducible framework** for studying AI methodology adaptation under competitive pressure.

*This branching protocol enables clean, scientific testing of whether market reality can cure AI over-engineering while maintaining experimental integrity.*
