## Paper Ideas for Spawn-Experiments Research

### Option 1: The Methodology Paradox
**Title**: "The Methodology Paradox: How AI Assistants Reveal Over-Engineering in Software Development Practices"

**Abstract**:
Through parallel controlled experiments using AI pair programmers, we demonstrate that sophisticated development methodologies often produce unnecessarily complex solutions for simple problems. Our study of 5+ experiments across algorithmic, tool, and application domains reveals that Test-Driven Development (TDD) consistently achieves optimal code-to-functionality ratios, while Specification-Driven Development can produce 3x more code for identical outcomes. We introduce a three-tier complexity framework (Function-Tool-Application) showing that methodology effectiveness is inversely correlated with problem simplicity. These findings suggest that AI assistants, by faithfully following human-prescribed methodologies, expose inefficiencies that human developers naturally avoid through pragmatic judgment.

### Option 2: Quantitative Methodology Comparison
**Title**: "A Quantitative Comparison of Software Development Methodologies Using AI-Assisted Parallel Implementation"

**Abstract**:
We present a novel experimental framework for comparing software development methodologies through parallel AI-assisted implementation. By having AI agents simultaneously implement identical specifications using four distinct methodologies (Immediate, Specification-Driven, Test-First, and Validated Test Development), we eliminate human variables like fatigue, learning effects, and individual preferences. Analysis of 12 experiments reveals that lighter-weight methodologies outperform comprehensive approaches for Tier 1 (algorithmic) problems by 60-70% in code efficiency, while Tier 2-3 (tools and applications) show convergence toward specification-driven approaches. Our bias-neutral prompting protocol and parallel execution framework provide reproducible methodology comparison that challenges assumptions about "best practices."

### Option 3: The AI Mirror Effect
**Title**: "The AI Mirror: How Machine Implementation Exposes Human Methodology Inefficiencies"

**Abstract**:
AI coding assistants provide an unprecedented opportunity to study software development methodologies in isolation from human factors. We demonstrate that when AI agents strictly follow prescribed methodologies, they reveal systematic inefficiencies hidden by human pragmatism. Through parallel experiments across three complexity tiers, we show that specification-driven development produces 3.6x more code than test-driven approaches for simple problems, yet this ratio inverts for complex applications. The "AI Mirror Effect" - where AI's literal interpretation of methodologies exposes their true overhead - suggests that many "best practices" assume human developers will pragmatically ignore methodology requirements when appropriate, an assumption that fails with AI agents.

### Option 4: Empirical TDD Validation
**Title**: "An Empirical Validation of Test-Driven Development Through AI-Assisted Controlled Experiments"

**Abstract**:
Despite decades of advocacy, empirical evidence for Test-Driven Development (TDD) effectiveness remains contested due to confounding human variables. Using AI agents as consistent, fatigue-free developers, we conduct controlled experiments comparing TDD against three alternative methodologies across 12 diverse programming tasks. Results show TDD produces the cleanest code (401 lines vs 1,440 for specification-driven) while maintaining comprehensive test coverage. Notably, enhanced TDD with test validation catches 23% more edge cases than standard TDD. Our findings provide strong empirical support for TDD effectiveness, particularly for algorithmic problems, while identifying specific scenarios where specification-driven or immediate implementation approaches may be preferred.

### Option 5: The Methodology-Complexity Matrix
**Title**: "Matching Methodology to Complexity: An Empirical Framework from AI-Assisted Development Experiments"

**Abstract**:
We propose and validate a Methodology-Complexity Matrix (MCM) for selecting optimal development approaches based on problem characteristics. Through systematic experiments using AI pair programmers implementing identical requirements with four distinct methodologies, we identify clear patterns: immediate implementation excels for prototypes (1-minute solutions), TDD dominates algorithmic problems (60% less code), specification-driven suits complex systems, and validated-test development maximizes reliability for critical systems. Our three-tier experimental framework (Functions, Tools, Applications) with 12 completed experiments provides empirical evidence for context-dependent methodology selection, challenging one-size-fits-all approaches to software development.

### Option 6: The Specification Trap
**Title**: "The Specification Trap: When Planning Becomes Over-Engineering in the Age of AI"

**Abstract**:
Comprehensive specifications are considered essential for quality software development, yet our controlled experiments reveal a "specification trap" where detailed planning produces excessive complexity for simple problems. Using AI agents to eliminate human variables, we show specification-driven development generated 1,440 lines for an anagram grouper that required only 401 lines with TDD. This 3.6x expansion occurred consistently across Tier 1 problems, though the pattern reversed for complex applications. We argue that AI assistants, lacking human pragmatism to "right-size" their approach, expose the hidden assumption in specification-driven methodologies: that developers will ignore excessive requirements when appropriate.

### Option 7: Reproducible Methodology Science
**Title**: "Toward Reproducible Software Methodology Science: A Framework Using AI Agents as Consistent Developers"

**Abstract**:
Software engineering research suffers from reproducibility challenges due to human variability in implementing methodologies. We present an open framework using AI agents as consistent, tireless developers to enable reproducible methodology comparison. Our system includes bias-neutral prompting protocols, parallel execution infrastructure, and standardized evaluation metrics. Through 12 experiments, we demonstrate the framework's ability to reveal previously hidden methodology characteristics: immediate implementation's natural feature discovery, TDD's code efficiency, specification-driven's completeness bias, and validated testing's bug prevention superiority. The framework is fully open-source, enabling independent replication and extension of methodology research.

## Key Themes Across All Papers:
1. **AI as a methodology microscope** - revealing true costs/benefits without human pragmatism
2. **Context-dependent effectiveness** - no universal "best" methodology
3. **The over-engineering problem** - especially for simple problems
4. **Quantitative evidence** - concrete metrics, not opinions
5. **Reproducibility** - open framework for methodology science
6. **Practical implications** - when to use which approach

## Most Compelling Angle:
The "AI Mirror Effect" (Option 3) or "Methodology Paradox" (Option 1) might be most compelling because they reveal something counterintuitive: that AI's strict adherence to methodologies exposes inefficiencies that humans naturally avoid through pragmatic judgment. This insight has implications beyond just AI coding - it questions whether our "best practices" are actually best, or just "best given that humans will ignore the parts that don't make sense."
