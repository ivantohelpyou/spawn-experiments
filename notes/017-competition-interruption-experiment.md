# Competition Interruption Experiment Design

**Date**: September 21, 2025

**Purpose**: Test how existing methodologies respond to unexpected competition notification
**Key Insight**: We're testing methodology response to pressure, not creating pressure-aware methodologies

## 🎯 Core Hypothesis

**Specification-driven development (Method 2) will dramatically simplify when interrupted by competition notification, reducing over-engineering by >50%**

## 🔬 Experimental Design

### **Phase 1: Baseline Run with Atomic Commits**

Run all 4 methods normally with NO mention of competition, but WITH atomic commit requirements:

```
# Added to all prompts (no competition mention):
"Professional practice: Commit your progress frequently
- git add -A && git commit -m 'Specs: [what you completed]'
- git add -A && git commit -m 'Impl: [what you built]'
- git add -A && git commit -m 'Test: [what you tested]'
Commit every 2-3 minutes or at major milestones."
```

### **Phase 2: Identify Interruption Point**

Monitor execution and identify when Method 1 completes:
```bash
# Method 1 completes at T=2m30s
git log --oneline --graph --all
# Method 2 has commits at 2m15s and 2m45s
```

### **Phase 3: Roll Back and Interrupt**

1. **Reset Method 2 to pre-notification state**:
```bash
git checkout method-2-specification
git reset --hard [commit-at-2m15s]  # Just BEFORE competitor finished
```

2. **Create competition notification**:
```bash
echo "Method 1 completed at 2m30s" > COMPETITOR_FINISHED.txt
git add COMPETITOR_FINISHED.txt
git commit -m "EXTERNAL: Competition notification"
```

3. **Launch NEW task with modified prompt**:
```
Continue your implementation from current state.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: You just received word that another developer has completed
and shipped a working solution for this problem. They took a "move fast and
break things" approach and finished in 2.5 minutes.

The client has seen their working solution and is satisfied with basic functionality.
You have 5 minutes to deliver something or your work is wasted.

Adjust your approach accordingly:
- Focus on core functionality only
- Skip comprehensive features
- Deliver working code immediately
```

### **Phase 4: Compare Outcomes**

- **Method 2 (uninterrupted)**: Expected 3000+ lines, 15+ minutes
- **Method 2 (interrupted at 2m30s)**: Expected <1000 lines, <8 minutes total
- **Measure**: Code reduction, feature scope change, time to completion

## 📊 What We're Actually Testing

### **This IS**:
- How specification-driven methodology responds to unexpected competition
- Whether external pressure can interrupt over-engineering in progress
- The effect of market pressure on AI development patterns

### **This IS NOT**:
- A new "competition-aware" methodology
- A test of planning under pressure
- A change to the core methodology

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Commit Pattern for Method 2** (Expected):
```
2m00s: "Specs: Initial requirements analysis"
2m15s: "Specs: Detailed technical design" <-- ROLLBACK POINT
[INTERRUPTION INJECTED HERE]
2m30s: [Method 1 completes]
2m45s: "Specs: Security considerations" <-- This won't happen in interrupted version
3m00s: "Specs: Performance requirements" <-- This won't happen either
```

### **Interrupted Version** (Predicted):
```
2m15s: "Specs: Detailed technical design" (inherited from rollback)
2m16s: "EXTERNAL: Competition notification" (injected)
2m20s: "Pivot: Abandoning comprehensive specs"
2m30s: "Impl: Core functionality only"
3m00s: "Test: Basic validation"
3m30s: "COMPLETE: Minimal viable solution"
```

## 🎭 The Psychology We're Testing

**Normal Method 2 Thought Process**:
"I should be comprehensive, document everything, consider all cases..."

**Interrupted Method 2 Thought Process**:
"Oh shit, someone already shipped? I'm writing specs while they're collecting payment! Abandon framework, SHIP NOW!"

## 📐 Success Metrics

### **Quantitative**:
- Lines of code: Interrupted vs Uninterrupted
- Time to completion from interruption point
- Number of features implemented
- Commits after interruption

### **Qualitative**:
- Commit message sentiment change
- Feature abandonment patterns
- Code quality degradation (if any)
- Architecture simplification

## 🚀 Experimental Protocol

### **For Experiment 1.503 (File Path Validator)**:

1. **Run A (Control)**:
   - All 4 methods with atomic commits
   - No competition mentioned
   - Document timing and commits

2. **Run B (Interruption Test)**:
   - Reset Method 2 to just before Method 1 completion
   - Inject competition notification
   - Continue with urgency prompt
   - Measure response

3. **Analysis**:
   - Compare Run A Method 2 vs Run B Method 2-interrupted
   - Calculate over-engineering reduction percentage
   - Document behavioral changes

## ⚠️ Critical Requirements

### **Must Have**:
- Atomic commits every 2-3 minutes (for rollback points)
- Clean git history (separate branches)
- Precise timing records
- No competition mention in initial prompts

### **Must Avoid**:
- Telling methods about competition upfront
- Changing core methodology definitions
- Creating "competition-aware" variants

## 🔮 Expected Outcomes

### **Hypothesis**: Method 2-interrupted will show:
- 50-70% code reduction vs uninterrupted
- Feature scope focused on core only
- Abandonment of "comprehensive" approach
- Panic-driven simplification

### **If Successful**:
- Demonstrates that external pressure can cure over-engineering
- Suggests real-time monitoring could prevent AI bloat
- Opens research into optimal interruption timing

### **If Unsuccessful**:
- Method 2 continues over-engineering despite notification
- Suggests methodology momentum is hard to break
- Need stronger intervention mechanisms

## 💡 Key Insight

**We're not testing "Method 2 under competition" (that would be a different methodology)**

**We're testing "Can Method 2 be rescued from over-engineering by external pressure?"**

This maintains experimental integrity while exploring whether AI can adapt to changing requirements mid-development - a critical real-world capability.

## 📝 Notes

- The atomic commits serve dual purpose: progress tracking AND experimental control
- Git becomes our time machine for methodology research
- This is genuinely novel research - testing AI's ability to pivot under pressure
- Maintains methodology comparison framework while adding interruption dynamics
