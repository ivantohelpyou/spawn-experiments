# Notes Directory

This directory is for private notes, drafts, and work-in-progress documentation that should not be committed to the repository.

This entire `/notes/` directory is excluded from git via `.gitignore`.

## Naming Convention

Use numerical prefixes for all notes to maintain order:
- `001-paper-ideas.md`
- `002-blog-mythical-man-month.md`
- `003-next-topic.md`

## Use this space for:
- Experiment planning notes
- Draft reports before finalizing
- Personal observations and thoughts
- Meeting notes
- Todo lists and brainstorming
- Blog post drafts
- Paper abstracts and outlines
- Any other temporary or private documentation

Files in this directory will remain local to your machine only.
