## üß™ Experiment Design: 4-Method QRCards Rebuild

### **Experiment 2.650 - QRCards Rebuild Comparison**

**Specification**:
"Rebuild the QRCards application with user management, QR card creation/management,
multiple QR formats, custom styling, analytics, and web interface using the
Flask + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + segno stack"

**Research Questions**:
1. **Database Design**: How do methodologies approach user/card/analytics schema design?
2. **Flask Architecture**: What application structure patterns emerge?
3. **QR Integration**: How is segno integrated for different QR card types?
4. **Web Interface**: What approaches to templates, forms, and user experience?
5. **Testing Strategy**: How are database + web application components tested?
6. **Migration Strategy**: How is schema evolution and data migration handled?
7. **Production Quality**: Which approach produces the most maintainable/deployable application?

### **Method Predictions for QRCards**

#### **Method 1: Immediate QRCards Implementation**
```
Predicted Approach:
- Quick Flask app with basic routes
- Simple SQLAlchemy models (User, Card, QRCode)
- Direct segno integration in route handlers
- Basic Jinja2 templates with minimal styling
- Essential features first, polish later

Strengths:
- Fastest to working QRCards application
- Pragmatic feature prioritization
- Direct, understandable code structure

Risks:
- May skip Flask best practices (blueprints, factory pattern)
- Basic error handling and validation
- Limited test coverage
- Quick fixes that become technical debt
```

#### **Method 2: Specification-Driven QRCards**
```
Predicted Approach:
- Comprehensive QRCards feature specification
- Complex database schema with extensive relationships
- Advanced Flask architecture (blueprints, services, repositories)
- Professional template hierarchy and component system
- Extensive configuration and customization options

Strengths:
- Thorough feature coverage
- Professional application architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Extensible design for future features

Risks:
- Over-engineered for QRCards scope
- Complex abstraction layers over Flask/SQLAlchemy
- Feature bloat beyond actual needs
- Development time explosion (32.3X pattern risk)
```

#### **Method 3: TDD QRCards Development**
```
Predicted Approach:
- Test-driven database model development
- Flask route testing with database fixtures
- QR code generation testing and validation
- Template rendering and form submission testing
- Integration testing for complete user workflows

Strengths:
- Reliable QRCards functionality
- Good test coverage for all features
- Clean model and API design
- Confidence in deployment and changes

Considerations:
- May require learning Flask testing patterns
- Test setup complexity for database + web testing
- Balanced feature scope driven by test requirements
```

#### **Method 4: Adaptive TDD QRCards**
```
Predicted Approach (with constraints):
- Strategic analysis of QRCards requirements
- Balanced Flask architecture leveraging framework strengths
- Thoughtful segno integration patterns
- Targeted testing of critical QRCards functionality
- Clean deployment and migration strategy

Predicted Approach (without constraints):
- Custom QR card framework built on Flask
- Extensive testing of every QRCards interaction
- Over-architected card management abstractions
- Complex migration and deployment procedures

Critical Constraint: "Build QRCards app using Flask patterns directly,
avoid building QR card frameworks on top of Flask"
```
