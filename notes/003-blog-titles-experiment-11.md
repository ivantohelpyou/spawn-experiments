# Blog Post Title Ideas for Experiment 011: Prime Number Generator

## Key Findings to Emphasize:
- **Zero defects**: Method 4 achieved mathematically proven correctness
- **Speed vs Quality**: Method 1 fastest (4m 1s) vs Method 4 highest quality (6m 15s)
- **Test validation innovation**: 6 incorrect implementations caught during validation
- **Architecture emergence**: Different methodologies = different optimal architectures
- **Algorithm diversity**: Each method naturally chose different optimization strategies

## Most Compelling Angles:

1. **Zero Defects (Option 1)** - The mathematical proof aspect is genuinely remarkable
2. **Test Validation Innovation (Options 4, 8)** - This is a genuinely novel approach that could change how people test
3. **Speed vs Quality (Option 2)** - Classic trade-off with surprising results
4. **Architecture Emergence (Option 5)** - Shows how methodology shapes solution more than requirements

## Recommended: Option 4 or 8
The test validation innovation is the most unique and actionable finding. The idea of deliberately testing wrong implementations to validate test quality is both counterintuitive and practically valuable. It's something readers could actually implement in their own work.

The "zero defects in 6 minutes" angle is also strong because it challenges the assumption that thorough testing is always slower.
