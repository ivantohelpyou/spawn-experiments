# Post-Experiment Protocol - Complete Walkthrough

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of the post-experiment protocol using a concrete example.

## Example Scenario: Experiment 1.501 - Email Validator

### Phase 1: Experiment Completion ‚úÖ
1. **Verify all 4 methods completed successfully** - check each folder has working code
2. **Confirm EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md exists** with timing analysis and comparative results
3. **Validate timing measurements** came from Task tool execution (not file timestamps)

### Phase 2: Extract Research Insights üî¨
4. **Review experiment results** and ask: What did we learn?
   - Method 1 took 2m15s, Method 4 took 12m30s
   - Regex validation emerged in all approaches
   - TDD created most comprehensive test suite

5. **Evaluate each research topic** for new insights:
   - **Methodology Selection**: When is TDD worth the overhead for validation problems?
   - **Development Speed**: Input validation shows different timing patterns than algorithms
   - **Code Quality**: How did test coverage vary across methods?
   - **Architecture**: What patterns emerged for validation logic organization?

6. **Update relevant finding documents** in `notes/findings/[topic]/`
   - Add email validator evidence to existing findings
   - Create new findings if significant insights emerged

### Phase 3: Project Documentation Updates üìù
7. **Update EXPERIMENT_INDEX.md**:
   ```markdown
   ### 1.501 - Email Validator ‚úÖ
   **Domain**: Input Validation | **Completed**: Sept 21, 2025
   **Key Finding**: TDD optimal for validation problems requiring comprehensive test coverage
   [Full Report](experiments/1.501-email-validator/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md)
   ```

8. **Update README.md homepage**:
   - Move current "LATEST EXPERIMENT" to "PREVIOUS"
   - Add new headline: "Email Validation - TDD Wins for Input Validation!"
   - Include compelling stats: timing, test coverage, etc.

9. **Update FUTURE_EXPERIMENTS_ROADMAP.md**:
   - Mark 1.501 as completed
   - Add insights: "Input validation benefits more from TDD than algorithmic problems"
   - Bump priority of related validation experiments

### Phase 4: Strategic Analysis (Private) üéØ
10. **Assess for personal project framework**:
    - Email validation patterns ‚Üí useful for client projects
    - TDD methodology ‚Üí when to recommend for validation work
    - Component candidates ‚Üí email validator for utils library

11. **Quality assurance check**:
    - Timing methodology followed correctly ‚úÖ
    - No bias in methodology execution ‚úÖ
    - Methodology authenticity maintained ‚úÖ

### Phase 5: Publication üöÄ
12. **Commit to private repo**: All changes, including private findings
13. **Push to public repo**: Automatically filtered by gitignore
14. **Verify public presentation**: Clean, professional, no private info exposed

### Phase 6: Next Steps üîÑ
15. **Plan follow-up**: Maybe 1.502 - URL Validator to test validation patterns
16. **Update research priorities**: Validation series showing promise
17. **Consider meta-analysis**: If enough validation experiments accumulated

## Key Principles

### Systematic Knowledge Building
Each experiment doesn't just produce results - it systematically builds knowledge across all four research topics:
- **Methodology Selection**: When to use which approaches
- **Development Speed**: Timing patterns and productivity insights
- **Code Quality**: How methodology affects maintainability/testing
- **Architecture Patterns**: Design patterns that emerge from methodologies

### Dual-Purpose Intelligence
- **Public Research**: Contributes to open methodology research
- **Private Strategy**: Informs business methodology decisions and personal project framework

### Quality Gates
- Never mark experiment complete without all 4 working implementations
- Always validate timing measurement methodology
- Ensure findings are evidence-based, not speculative
- Maintain professional public presentation

### Automation Opportunities
- Template generation for experiment index entries
- Automated timing extraction from Task tool output
- Finding document templates by research topic
- Link validation across documentation

**Usage**: Follow this walkthrough after each experiment completion to ensure consistent knowledge extraction and project maintenance.
