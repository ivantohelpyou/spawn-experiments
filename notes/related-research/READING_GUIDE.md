## 🔧 **Reading Tools and Strategies**

### **Mathematical Notation Decoder**

#### **Statistical Symbols**
- **μ (mu)** = mean/average
- **σ (sigma)** = standard deviation (spread of data)
- **p** = probability (p < 0.05 means "statistically significant")
- **r** = correlation coefficient (-1 to +1, how related two things are)
- **n** = sample size (number of things studied)

#### **Common Equations**
- **Standard Deviation**: σ = √(Σ(x-μ)²/n)
  - *Translation*: "How spread out the data is"
- **Confidence Interval**: μ ± 1.96σ/√n
  - *Translation*: "We're 95% confident the true value is in this range"
- **Effect Size**: (Group1_mean - Group2_mean) / pooled_standard_deviation
  - *Translation*: "How big is the practical difference?"

#### **Research Design Terms**
- **Independent Variable**: What you change (methodology in your case)
- **Dependent Variable**: What you measure (code quality, speed, etc.)
- **Control Group**: Comparison baseline
- **Randomization**: Assigning participants randomly to groups
- **Bias**: Systematic error that skews results
