### **Specific Links to Try**

#### **Chen et al. (2021) - Codex Paper**
- **arXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374
- **Status**: Should be freely available

#### **Hindle et al. (2012) - Naturalness Paper**
- **Google Scholar search**: "On the Naturalness of Software" Hindle
- **Try author sites**: Premkumar Devanbu (UC Davis), Abram Hindle (University of Alberta)

#### **Nagappan et al. (2008) - TDD Quality Paper**
- **Google Scholar search**: "Realizing quality improvement through test driven development"
- **Try**: Microsoft Research publications, Laurie Williams NCSU site

#### **Williams et al. (2003) - TDD Defects Paper**
- **Google Scholar search**: "Test-driven development as a defect-reduction practice"
- **Try**: NCSU Computer Science faculty pages

### **Email Templates for Authors**

#### **Template 1: Direct Paper Request**
```
Subject: Request for Paper - Methodology Research Connection

Dear Dr. [Author],

I'm conducting research on AI-assisted development methodologies and have found your paper "[Paper Title]" highly relevant to my work.

I'm studying how different development approaches (TDD, specification-driven, etc.) perform when paired with AI code generation tools. Your empirical findings on [specific topic] provide important foundation for this research.

Would you be willing to share a PDF of your paper? I'm happy to share my preliminary findings in return.

Best regards,
[Your name]

#### **Template 2: Research Collaboration Interest**
```
Subject: Empirical Software Engineering Research - AI Development Methodologies

Dear Dr. [Author],

I'm conducting systematic experiments comparing development methodologies (TDD, specification-driven, etc.) in AI-assisted development contexts. Your work on [specific topic] is directly relevant to my findings.

I've completed 11 controlled experiments showing [brief key finding]. I'd love to share results and discuss connections to your research.

Would you be interested in seeing my preliminary findings? I'm also seeking your paper "[Paper Title]" to strengthen the empirical foundation.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## üîÑ Acquisition Workflow

### **Daily Tasks (15 minutes)**
1. **Try 2-3 Google Scholar searches** for high-priority papers
2. **Check 1-2 author websites** for available PDFs
3. **Download any freely available papers** found

### **Weekly Tasks (30 minutes)**
1. **Send 2-3 emails** to authors requesting papers
2. **Check arXiv/ResearchGate** for new relevant publications
3. **Update acquisition checklist** with progress

### **Monthly Tasks (1 hour)**
1. **Review conference proceedings** (ICSE, FSE, ASE) for new papers
2. **Scan journal issues** (Empirical Software Engineering, TSE)
3. **Organize acquired papers** and update README

## üìä Progress Tracking

### **Current Status**
- **Acquired**: 1 paper (Hindle-2012.pdf - "On the Naturalness of Software")
- **High Priority Remaining**: 3 papers (Nagappan TDD, Chen Codex, Williams TDD)
- **Medium Priority**: 8 papers
- **Total Target**: ~15-20 papers

### **Success Metrics**
