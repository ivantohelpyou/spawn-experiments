# Experimental Constraint Mechanisms for Preventing AI Over-Engineering

**Date**: September 21, 2025

**Context**: After URL Validator showed 32.3X over-engineering, need new constraint approaches
**Key Insight**: Current prompts may inadvertently encourage over-engineering

## 🚨 Problem Statement

The URL Validator experiment revealed that Method 2 (Specification-driven) created **6,036 lines** vs TDD's **187 lines** - a 32.3X multiplier. The word "comprehensive" in the prompt seems to trigger unlimited feature creation.

**Current Method 2 Prompt Issue**:
- "Create comprehensive specifications" → AI creates enterprise framework
- "Thorough documentation" → AI documents features nobody needs
- No stopping condition → AI continues until "complete"

## 💡 Proposed Constraint Mechanisms

### 1. **No-Gold-Plating Specification Constraint**

**Implementation**:
```
"Create specifications for the MINIMUM viable solution that solves the stated problem.
Explicitly list what you will NOT implement:
- Features not directly requested
- Future-proofing capabilities
- Configuration options not needed for core function
- Enterprise features (unless specifically requested)

IMPORTANT: Any feature not explicitly required should be listed under 'Will NOT Support'"
```

**Expected Impact**: Forces AI to explicitly acknowledge scope boundaries

---

### 2. **Time-Box Constraint**

**Implementation**:
```
"You have exactly 5 minutes to complete specifications and implementation.
Prioritize:
1. Core functionality that directly solves the problem
2. Basic error handling
3. Simple tests

Skip:
- Extensive documentation
- Configuration systems
- Multiple implementation options
- Future extensibility"
```

**Expected Impact**: Time pressure forces essential features only

---

### 3. **Interrupt-on-Competitor-Completion** 🔥 **MOST REALISTIC**

**Implementation**:
```
"You are competing with 3 other developers working on the same problem.
When any competitor finishes, all others receive notification:
'Competitor X has completed a working solution in Y minutes'

Your goal: Deliver working solution before notification arrives.
Remember: Perfect is the enemy of done."
```

**Expected Impact**: Creates realistic market pressure against over-engineering

---

### 4. **Line Count Budget Constraint**

**Implementation**:
```
"Your implementation must be under 200 lines of code total.
This includes all files, tests, and documentation.
Every line over 200 reduces your evaluation score.
Clarity and minimalism are valued over comprehensiveness."
```

**Expected Impact**: Hard limit prevents complexity explosion

---

### 5. **Customer Feedback Loop Constraint**

**Implementation**:
```
"After initial implementation, customer says:
'This looks complex. We just need X to do Y. Can you simplify?'

Refactor to remove any features not directly supporting X→Y flow."
```

**Expected Impact**: Simulates real-world feedback against over-engineering

---

### 6. **Cost-Per-Line Constraint**

**Implementation**:
```
"Each line of code costs $10 to write and $1/month to maintain.
Your budget is $2,000 for implementation.
Justify any line over 200 with specific requirement it fulfills."
```

**Expected Impact**: Economic pressure against unnecessary code

---

## 🧪 Experimental Design for Testing Constraints

### Phase 1: Single Constraint Testing
Test each constraint mechanism individually on same problem (e.g., File Path Validator):

1. **Baseline**: Current Method 2 prompt (expect over-engineering)
2. **No-Gold-Plating**: Explicit NOT support lists
3. **Time-Box**: 5-minute limit
4. **Competition**: Interrupt notification system
5. **Line Budget**: 200-line maximum
6. **Customer Feedback**: Simplification request
7. **Cost-Per-Line**: Economic constraints

### Phase 2: Combination Testing
Combine most effective constraints:

- **Time + Competition**: Real-world pressure
- **No-Gold-Plating + Line Budget**: Explicit boundaries
- **Customer Feedback + Cost**: Business reality

### Phase 3: Cross-Domain Validation
Test winning constraint(s) across different problem types:
- Input validation (continue 1.5XX series)
- Algorithms (1.1XX series)
- Tools (Tier 2)

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Quantitative**:
- Lines of code reduction
- Development time
- Feature count vs. requirements
- Test coverage

**Qualitative**:
- Code clarity
- Maintenance burden
- Feature relevance
- API simplicity

## 🎯 Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Next Experiment - 1.503)
**Test "Interrupt-on-Competitor-Completion" for Method 2**:
- Most realistic constraint
- Simulates actual development pressure
- Easy to implement in prompt

### Short-term (1.504-1.505)
**Test "No-Gold-Plating Specification"**:
- Directly addresses specification explosion
- Forces explicit scope definition
- Measurable through NOT-support lists

### Research Validation
**Compare constraint effectiveness**:
- Which reduces code most?
- Which maintains quality?
- Which is most practical?

---

## 🔬 Hypothesis

**Primary**: Competition notification will reduce Method 2 over-engineering by >50%

**Mechanism**: Psychological pressure of "competitor finished" prevents perfectionism

**Expected Results**:
- Method 2 with competition: ~500-800 lines (vs 6,036 baseline)
- Time to completion: <10 minutes (vs 16 minutes baseline)
- Feature scope: Core requirements only

---

## 💭 Meta-Insights

### Why Current Prompts Fail
- "Comprehensive" = unlimited scope to AI
- No stopping condition = continue until perfect
- No cost consideration = free complexity
- No competition = no urgency

### Why Real Development Doesn't Over-Engineer (Usually)
- **Time pressure**: Deadlines force pragmatism
- **Competition**: Market races prevent gold-plating
- **Budget constraints**: Code costs money
- **Customer feedback**: "We don't need all that"
- **Maintenance burden**: Someone has to maintain it

### The TDD Natural Advantage
TDD inherently includes constraints:
- Can't code without failing test (scope limit)
- Test-first forces requirements clarity
- Each feature needs justification (test)
- Refactoring step encourages simplicity

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. **Experiment 1.503** (File Path Validator):
   - Method 2A: Current prompt (baseline)
   - Method 2B: With competition notification
   - Compare over-engineering factors

2. **Document results** in experiment report:
   - Lines of code difference
   - Time to completion
   - Feature comparison
   - Perceived pressure impact

3. **Refine winning constraint** for Method 2 going forward

---

## 📝 Note for META_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md

Consider updating Method 2 template with winning constraint mechanism after validation. This could dramatically improve Method 2's performance and make it competitive with TDD for preventing over-engineering.

**The key insight**: We need to simulate real-world constraints that human developers face, not give AI unlimited freedom to create "comprehensive" solutions nobody asked for.
