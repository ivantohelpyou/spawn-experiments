# AI Development Methodology Research

**Evidence-based comparison of AI-assisted development approaches through rigorous experimentation**

## üî¨ Research Overview

This repository contains **8 completed (or abandoned) methodology experiments** comparing four distinct approaches to AI-assisted software development. Each experiment applies the same four methods to different programming challenges, providing quantitative evidence that **how you prompt AI matters as much as what you prompt for**.

**Key Finding**: Methodology guidance dramatically improves AI-generated code quality, with Method 4 (Enhanced TDD) consistently producing the highest-quality, most maintainable solutions.

## üìä Completed Experiments

### Algorithmic Challenges
- **[008-lru-cache-ttl](experiments/008-lru-cache-ttl/)** - LRU Cache with Time-To-Live functionality
- **[007-lru-cache-ttl](experiments/007-lru-cache-ttl/)** - Alternative LRU Cache implementation  
- **[002-expression-evaluator](experiments/002-expression-evaluator/)** - Mathematical expression parser
- **[004-expression-evaluator-pytest](experiments/004-expression-evaluator-pytest/)** - Expression evaluator with pytest

### Application Development
- **[001-unicode-password-manager](experiments/001-unicode-password-manager/)** - Password manager with Unicode support
- **[005-temperature-converter](experiments/005-temperature-converter/)** - Temperature conversion utility
- **[006-simple-interest-calculator](experiments/006-simple-interest-calculator/)** - Financial calculation tool

### Partial Experiments
- **[003-simple-interest](experiments/003-simple-interest/)** - Simple interest calculator (Method 1 only)

## üß™ Four Development Methodologies

### Method 1: Naive Direct Approach
- **Prompt**: "Build a [APPLICATION] using [TECH_STACK]"
- **Characteristics**: No planning, minimal testing, quick implementation
- **Results**: Basic functionality, minimal error handling, no systematic testing

### Method 2: Specification-First Approach  
- **Approach**: Write detailed specifications before implementation
- **Characteristics**: Better planning and structure than naive approach
- **Results**: Improved documentation, some validation, clearer requirements

### Method 3: Traditional TDD Approach
- **Approach**: Strict Red-Green-Refactor cycles with tests written first
- **Characteristics**: Test-driven development discipline with AI assistance
- **Results**: Comprehensive test suites, robust error handling, clean refactored code

### Method 4: Enhanced TDD with Test Validation
- **Approach**: TDD plus rigorous test quality validation ("testing the tests")
- **Characteristics**: Highest confidence development with validated test effectiveness
- **Results**: Maximum test quality, thorough edge case coverage, bulletproof implementations

## üìà Quantitative Results

### Example: LRU Cache with TTL (Experiment 008)
- **Method 1**: 7m 11s, 23 tests, ~800+ lines (feature-rich but unfocused)
- **Method 2**: 6m 35s, 8 test suites, ~300-400 lines ‚ö° **fastest with quality**
- **Method 3**: 13m, 15 tests, ~200-300 lines (systematic but slower)
- **Method 4**: 9m, 26 tests, ~400+ lines ‚≠ê **highest confidence**

### Key Metrics Across All Experiments
- **Development Speed**: Method 2 consistently fastest while maintaining quality
- **Test Coverage**: Method 4 produces most comprehensive test suites
- **Code Quality**: Methods 3 & 4 show superior architecture and maintainability
- **Error Handling**: TDD approaches (3 & 4) demonstrate 3x better error handling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Run Your Own Methodology Comparison

1. **Choose your application**: Web app, CLI tool, algorithm, etc.
2. **Generate prompts**: Use `META_PROMPT_GENERATOR.md` template
3. **Execute experiments**: Run all four methods in parallel with separate AI agents
4. **Compare results**: Analyze code quality, test coverage, and maintainability

### Quick Start Example
```bash
# Generate prompts for a todo app
python generate_prompts.py --app "todo list application" --tech "Python Flask"

# Run automated experiment
./run_experiment.sh todo-app-flask
```
