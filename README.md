## 🔍 LATEST: Component Discovery Requires Guidance

**[Experiment 2.505.1: Guided Component Discovery](experiments/2.505.1-guided-component-discovery/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md)** *(September 22, 2025)*

**Key Finding**: AI agents don't naturally explore utils/ folders - but when told components are available, they use them effectively. Also: external libraries aren't always faster (70% time increase for richer features).

### **Component Discovery Results** 📊
- **Without guidance**: 0% discovery rate (agents don't scan existing codebases)
- **With simple hint**: 100% discovery rate across all methodologies
- **Integration patterns**: Each methodology handled components differently (fallback, registry, direct, strategic)
- **External library trade-off**: 70% time increase but richer features

### **What We Learned**
| Method | No Hint (2.505) | With Hint (2.505.1) | Pattern |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Method 1** | Built from scratch | Used utils + graceful fallback | Practical approach |
| **Method 1E** | N/A | Used external libraries | Feature-rich but slower |
| **Method 2** | Built from scratch | Professional component registry | Architectural approach |
| **Method 3** | Built from scratch | Direct jsonschema integration | Test-driven approach |
| **Method 4** | Built from scratch | Comprehensive component analysis | Quality-focused approach |

**Insight**: Agents need awareness of available components (sensible - you wouldn't want them scanning entire codebases by default). Once aware, they integrate components in methodology-consistent ways.

## ✅ FRAMEWORK VALIDATION: Spawn-Experiments Basics Working Perfectly

**[Experiment 1.506: IPv4/IPv6 Address Validator](experiments/1.506-ipv4-ipv6-address-validator/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md)** *(September 25, 2025)*

**Framework Status**: All methodology patterns working as expected. Method 2 continues 3.42X over-engineering, Method 3 TDD optimal baseline, Task tool approach superior to spawn_manager.py for parallel execution.

**Ready for Advanced Studies**: ✅ Framework validated for Tier 2 CLI tools and complex system experiments.

## 🔮 PREVIOUS BREAKTHROUGH: AI Bias Detection Through Prediction Accountability

**[Experiment 1.504: Date Format Validator + V4 Framework Enhancement](experiments/1.504-date-format-validator/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md)** *(September 21, 2025)*

**V4.1 Adaptive TDD**: 4m 1s development, 1,008,877 validations/sec, optimal balance achieved. AI bias detection through pre-experiment predictions reveals systematic underestimation of simple approaches and severe underestimation of specification complexity explosion.

## 📰 PREVIOUS: String Processing Domain Complete

**[Experiment 1.103: Roman Numeral Converter](experiments/1.103-roman-numeral-converter/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md)** *(September 2025)*

Fastest TDD implementation at 3m 37s! All four methodologies delivered working converters with different architectural approaches to the classic algorithm problem. TDD proved optimal for well-defined algorithmic challenges. [Read the full report →](experiments/1.103-roman-numeral-converter/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md)

**The Verdict**: For Tier 1 algorithmic problems, lighter approaches win. Save the heavy specs for complex systems!

## 🔬 Research Overview

This repository contains a **mature experimental framework** for studying AI-assisted development methodologies, with **16 completed experiments** and the enhanced **V4.2 Framework** with component discovery protocols. The research provides quantitative evidence that **methodology guidance significantly impacts AI development patterns and outcomes**, **component discovery requires explicit awareness**, and reveals **external vs internal component trade-offs**.

## 🔬 **Key Research Discoveries**

### 1. **Component Discovery Needs Guidance** 🔍 *(Latest)*
**AI agents require explicit awareness of available components.**
- **0% → 100% discovery rate** with simple hint about utils/ folder
- **Methodology characteristics preserved** - each approach integrated components differently
- **External library insight** - 70% time increase for richer features, not always faster
- **Enables composition research** - can now study component integration patterns

### 2. **V4.1 Adaptive TDD Framework** 🏆
**AI judgment-driven methodology achieves optimal balance across all metrics.**
- **4m 1s development time** (near-immediate speed)
- **1,008,877 validations/sec** (superior runtime performance)
- **Strategic validation** only where complexity warrants
- **Proven winner** across input validation domain experiments

### 3. **AI Bias Detection Through Prediction Accountability** 🔮
**Pre-experiment predictions reveal systematic biases in AI methodology assessment.**
- **Underestimates simple approaches** - assumes quality gaps that don't exist
- **Severely underestimates specification complexity** - 116-223% prediction errors
- **Accurately calibrated for TDD** - well-understood constraint mechanisms
- **Framework self-improvement** through bias awareness and correction

### 3. **Method 3 as Constraint-Driven Baseline** 🔧 *(Latest)*
**Pure TDD serves as consistent "mechanical rabbit" for competitive optimization.**
- **6-8 minute development time** (predictable performance)
- **~200 lines for input validation** (natural constraint mechanism)
- **100% implementation success rate** (reliable quality baseline)
- **Natural over-engineering prevention** through test-driven constraints

### 4. **AI Over-Engineering Epidemic + REVERSIBILITY BREAKTHROUGH** 🚨
**Unconstrained AI spontaneously creates 3-32X more complexity than needed, BUT can be rescued with proper intervention.**
- **Input Validation Pattern**: Method 2 averages 12.4X over-engineering across 4 experiments
- **File Path Validator**: 4,530-line enterprise platform (22.1X) **→ Rescued to 687 lines with competition injection**
- **URL Validator**: 6,036 lines with spontaneous enterprise features (32.3X over-engineering)
- **Revolutionary finding**: Over-engineering is **reversible** through competitive pressure

### 5. **The Complexity-Matching Principle** 🎯
**Methodology choice should match problem complexity, not follow universal application.**
- Simple problems: V4.1 Adaptive TDD or Immediate Implementation optimal
- Complex problems: Method 3 TDD baseline or enterprise specification-driven
- **Mismatch creates dangerous over/under-engineering**

### 6. **Security Through Constraints** 🛡️
**AI validation without constraints creates security vulnerabilities.**
- Method 1 accepts 7 invalid email formats that bypass security
- Methods 2,3,4 properly reject malformed inputs
- **Immediate implementation risks permissive validation**

**Meta-Finding**: Different methodologies produce measurably different approaches to problem-solving, component discovery, and system architecture across complexity levels.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**To run your own experiment:** Say `spawn-experiments` to Claude, provide your application idea, and get four bias-neutral prompts ready for parallel execution.

**Example:**
```
> spawn-experiments
Claude: What APPLICATION_TYPE and TECH_STACK?
> Password generator with Python and cryptographic libraries
```

You'll receive four complete prompts following bias prevention protocols, ready for simultaneous execution with timing and comparison analysis.

### Spawn Experiments - Parallel Launch Method (Recommended)

**Standard Protocol:**
1. **Start in this directory**: `cd /home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments`
2. **Launch Claude**: Say "spawn-experiments" to activate META_PROMPT_GENERATOR
3. **Provide details**: Give your APPLICATION_TYPE and TECH_STACK
4. **Get four prompts**: Receive complete prompts ready for parallel execution
5. **Launch in parallel**: Use single message with four Task tool calls for simultaneous execution
6. **Generate report**: Create comprehensive EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md with findings

### Example Session with Parallel Launch
```bash
cd /home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments
claude

# In Claude Code:
> spawn-experiments
Claude: What APPLICATION_TYPE and TECH_STACK?
> Multilingual word counter with Python language detection libraries

Claude: [Generates 4 complete prompts]

# Then immediately launch all four methods in parallel:
# Task tool calls for Method 1, 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously
# Wait for all to complete, then generate comprehensive report
```

### Legacy Manual Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# For contributors without access to Task tool parallel launch
# Create separate Claude Code sessions manually
# Navigate each to respective method directory
# Paste corresponding prompt and execute sequentially
```
