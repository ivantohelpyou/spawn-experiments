# Issues Found in Naive Implementation

## Critical Unicode Problems

### 1. Unicode Normalization Failures ❌
- **Problem**: `café` (precomposed) vs `cafe´` (decomposed) are treated as different
- **Impact**: Users cannot find their passwords if they type the "same" characters differently
- **Example**: Storing "café" but searching for "cafe´" returns no results

### 2. Homograph Attack Vulnerability 🚨
- **Problem**: `раssword` (Cyrillic) vs `password` (Latin) both accepted as different entries
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability - attackers could create lookalike entries
- **Example**: Two "password" entries that look identical but use different character sets

### 3. Inconsistent Character Counting
- **Problem**: Emoji sequences counted as multiple characters
- **Impact**: Password length validation would be wrong
- **Example**: Family emoji `👨‍👩‍👧‍👦` shows as 7 code points but is 1 visual character

### 4. Case Sensitivity Issues
- **Problem**: Unicode case folding not handled properly
- **Impact**: Search fails for different cases of non-ASCII characters
- **Example**: `ĞMÁIL` vs `ğmáil` treated as different

### 5. Search Functionality Broken
- **Problem**: Naive string matching fails with Unicode
- **Impact**: Users cannot find entries with Unicode characters
- **Example**: Searching "target" doesn't find "🎯 Target Account"

### 6. Password Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Random Unicode characters mixed with ASCII unpredictably
- **Impact**: Passwords have inconsistent encoding and length
- **Example**: Generated passwords range from 10-22 bytes for "10 characters"

### 7. JSON Storage Encoding
- **Problem**: All Unicode escaped to ASCII in storage
- **Impact**: Human-unreadable storage, potential corruption
- **Example**: `🔐` stored as `\ud83d\udd10`

## Security Vulnerabilities

1. **No Encryption**: Passwords stored in plain text
2. **No Master Password**: Anyone can access the file
3. **Homograph Attacks**: Lookalike characters accepted
4. **No Input Validation**: Any string accepted as service name/password

## Usability Issues

1. **Broken Search**: Unicode-aware search fails
2. **Inconsistent Display**: Characters may not render properly
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Unexpected behavior with international characters
4. **No Password Strength Validation**: Weak passwords accepted

## What Worked

✅ Basic CRUD operations
✅ JSON persistence
✅ Simple password generation
✅ Unicode characters can be stored and retrieved (if exact match)
✅ Emoji display in terminal (mostly)

## Conclusion

The naive approach creates a fundamentally broken password manager when Unicode is involved. While basic functionality works, critical issues around normalization, security, and search make it unsuitable for real use.

**Issues Count**: 7 critical Unicode problems + 4 security vulnerabilities + 4 usability issues = **15 major issues**

This demonstrates why proper planning and testing are essential when dealing with Unicode and security-critical applications.
