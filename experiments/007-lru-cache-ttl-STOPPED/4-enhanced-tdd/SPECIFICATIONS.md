# LRU Cache with TTL - Comprehensive Specifications

## 1. Core Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Cache Fundamentals
- **R1.1**: The cache MUST store key-value pairs with configurable maximum capacity
- **R1.2**: The cache MUST implement Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy
- **R1.3**: The cache MUST support Time-To-Live (TTL) for automatic expiration
- **R1.4**: The cache MUST be thread-safe for concurrent access
- **R1.5**: The cache MUST provide O(1) average time complexity for get/set operations

### 1.2 Storage Requirements
- **R2.1**: Keys must be hashable Python objects (strings, numbers, tuples)
- **R2.2**: Values can be any Python object
- **R2.3**: Cache must handle memory efficiently with automatic cleanup
- **R2.4**: Cache must support dynamic resizing (within session)

### 1.3 Eviction Requirements
- **R3.1**: When capacity is exceeded, least recently used item MUST be evicted
- **R3.2**: Expired items (TTL exceeded) MUST be automatically removed
- **R3.3**: Manual eviction of specific keys MUST be supported
- **R3.4**: Bulk cleanup operations MUST be available

## 2. User Stories with Acceptance Criteria

### 2.1 As a Developer, I want to create a cache instance
**Story**: As a developer, I want to initialize an LRU cache with specific capacity and default TTL settings so that I can manage memory usage and data freshness.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I want to create a cache
- When I initialize LRUCacheWithTTL(capacity=100, default_ttl=300)
- Then I should get a cache instance with capacity 100 and default TTL 300 seconds
- And the cache should be empty initially
- And the cache should be ready to accept key-value pairs

### 2.2 As a Developer, I want to store and retrieve data
**Story**: As a developer, I want to store data in the cache and retrieve it efficiently so that I can improve application performance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have a cache instance
- When I set cache["key"] = "value"
- Then I should be able to retrieve cache["key"] and get "value"
- And the operation should complete in O(1) average time
- And the key should be marked as most recently used

### 2.3 As a System Administrator, I want automatic memory management
**Story**: As a system administrator, I want the cache to automatically manage memory by evicting old data so that the application doesn't consume unlimited memory.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have a cache with capacity=3
- When I add 4 items to the cache
- Then the least recently used item should be automatically evicted
- And the cache should contain exactly 3 items
- And the 3 most recently used items should remain

### 2.4 As a Developer, I want automatic data expiration
**Story**: As a developer, I want cached data to automatically expire after a specified time so that I always work with fresh data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I set an item with TTL=1 second
- When I wait for 2 seconds
- Then the item should no longer be accessible
- And attempting to get the item should return None or raise KeyError
- And the expired item should be removed from cache storage

### 2.5 As a Developer, I want cache statistics
**Story**: As a developer, I want to monitor cache performance through statistics so that I can optimize cache configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have a cache with some operations
- When I request cache statistics
- Then I should get hit rate, miss rate, eviction count, and current size
- And the statistics should be accurate and up-to-date
- And the statistics should help me understand cache effectiveness

## 4. Data Models and Relationships

### 4.1 Cache Entry Model
```python
@dataclass
class CacheEntry:
    key: Hashable
    value: Any
    timestamp: float
    ttl: Optional[float]
    access_time: float
    prev: Optional['CacheEntry'] = None
    next: Optional['CacheEntry'] = None
```

### 4.2 Cache Statistics Model
```python
@dataclass
class CacheStats:
    hits: int = 0
    misses: int = 0
    evictions: int = 0
    current_size: int = 0
    capacity: int = 0
    hit_rate: float = 0.0
    miss_rate: float = 0.0
```

### 4.3 Core Data Structures
- **Main Storage**: `Dict[Hashable, CacheEntry]` for O(1) access
- **LRU Chain**: Doubly linked list for efficient reordering
- **TTL Index**: Optional timestamp-based index for efficient cleanup

## 5. API Design

### 5.1 Core Interface
```python
class LRUCacheWithTTL:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int, default_ttl: Optional[float] = None)
    def get(self, key: Hashable) -> Any
    def set(self, key: Hashable, value: Any, ttl: Optional[float] = None) -> None
    def delete(self, key: Hashable) -> bool
    def clear(self) -> None
    def size(self) -> int
    def capacity(self) -> int
    def keys(self) -> List[Hashable]
    def values(self) -> List[Any]
    def items(self) -> List[Tuple[Hashable, Any]]
```

### 5.2 Dictionary-like Interface
```python
def __getitem__(self, key: Hashable) -> Any
def __setitem__(self, key: Hashable, value: Any) -> None
def __delitem__(self, key: Hashable) -> None
def __contains__(self, key: Hashable) -> bool
def __len__(self) -> int
def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[Hashable]
```

### 5.3 Statistics and Maintenance
```python
def stats(self) -> CacheStats
def cleanup_expired(self) -> int
def resize(self, new_capacity: int) -> None
def is_expired(self, key: Hashable) -> bool
```

## 6. Business Rules and Validation Requirements

### 6.1 Capacity Rules
- **BR1**: Capacity must be a positive integer (>= 1)
- **BR2**: When capacity is reduced, oldest items must be evicted first
- **BR3**: Capacity of 0 is invalid and should raise ValueError

### 6.2 TTL Rules
- **BR4**: TTL must be None (no expiration) or positive float
- **BR5**: TTL of 0 means immediate expiration
- **BR6**: Negative TTL values are invalid and should raise ValueError
- **BR7**: Default TTL applies to items without explicit TTL

### 6.3 Key Rules
- **BR8**: Keys must be hashable (strings, numbers, tuples, etc.)
- **BR9**: Keys cannot be None
- **BR10**: Empty string is a valid key

### 6.4 Value Rules
- **BR11**: Values can be any Python object including None
- **BR12**: Values should be pickleable for potential persistence

### 6.5 Concurrency Rules
- **BR13**: All operations must be atomic
- **BR14**: Statistics must be consistent across concurrent access
- **BR15**: No data corruption under concurrent load

## 7. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### 7.1 Exception Hierarchy
```python
class CacheError(Exception): pass
class CacheCapacityError(CacheError): pass
class CacheTTLError(CacheError): pass
class CacheKeyError(CacheError): pass
```

### 7.2 Error Scenarios
- **E1**: Invalid capacity (≤ 0) → CacheCapacityError
- **E2**: Invalid TTL (< 0) → CacheTTLError
- **E3**: Unhashable key → CacheKeyError
- **E4**: Getting non-existent key → KeyError (standard Python behavior)
- **E5**: Memory exhaustion → MemoryError (system level)

### 7.3 Edge Cases
- **EC1**: Cache with capacity=1 (single item cache)
- **EC2**: All items expired simultaneously
- **EC3**: Rapid succession of identical operations
- **EC4**: Very large objects causing memory pressure
- **EC5**: Clock adjustments affecting TTL calculations
- **EC6**: Extreme TTL values (microseconds to years)

### 7.4 Graceful Degradation
- **GD1**: When memory is low, cache should evict aggressively
- **GD2**: Statistics collection should never fail operations
- **GD3**: TTL calculations should handle clock skew gracefully
- **GD4**: Operations should complete even under high contention

## 8. Performance Requirements

### 8.1 Time Complexity Guarantees
- **get()**: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (hash collision)
- **set()**: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (hash collision + eviction)
- **delete()**: O(1) average
- **cleanup_expired()**: O(n) where n is number of items to check

### 8.2 Memory Requirements
- **Overhead**: Maximum 200% of stored data size
- **Fragmentation**: Minimize through efficient data structures
- **Cleanup**: Automatic garbage collection of expired entries

### 8.3 Scalability Targets
- **Capacity**: Support up to 10^6 entries efficiently
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle 100+ concurrent threads
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ operations/second on modern hardware

### 9.2 Test Data Strategy
- **Small Data**: Simple strings and numbers

### 9.3 Coverage Requirements
