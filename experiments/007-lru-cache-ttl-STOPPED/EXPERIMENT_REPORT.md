# LRU Cache with TTL: Four-Method Comparison Report

**Experiment**: 007-lru-cache-ttl
**Date**: September 17, 2025
**Challenge**: Implement an LRU Cache with Time-To-Live (TTL) functionality
**Programming Language**: Python

## Executive Summary

This experiment compared four different development approaches for implementing a complex algorithmic challenge: an LRU Cache with TTL support. All four methods successfully delivered working implementations, but with significant differences in development time, code quality, documentation depth, and architectural sophistication.

**Key Finding**: More sophisticated methodologies produced demonstrably better results in terms of code quality, test coverage, and documentation, but with diminishing returns on time investment.

## Methodology Overview

Four parallel development sessions implemented the same algorithmic challenge:

1. **Method 1**: Direct Implementation (Naive Approach)
2. **Method 2**: Specification-First Implementation
3. **Method 3**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
4. **Method 4**: Enhanced TDD with Test Validation

Each method operated independently with identical requirements but different development processes.

## Recommendations

### For Different Project Types

**Enterprise/Production Systems**: Use Method 2 (Specification-First)
- Comprehensive documentation enables team collaboration
- Thread safety and error handling critical for production
- Detailed specifications guide maintenance and feature additions

**Rapid Prototyping**: Use Method 1 (Direct Implementation)
- Fastest time to working prototype
- Good balance of features and development speed
- Excellent for proof-of-concept development

**Learning/Training**: Use Method 4 (Enhanced TDD)
- Explicit validation process teaches testing discipline
- Comprehensive methodology documentation
- Good for building TDD skills

**Research/Experimentation**: Use Method 3 (Pure TDD)
- Minimal, focused implementation
- Clear test-driven process
- Good for algorithm exploration

### For AI-Assisted Development

**Key Observation**: AI agents successfully delivered sophisticated implementations across all methodologies, suggesting that methodology choice remains important even with AI assistance.

**Best Practices for AI Teams**:
1. Provide clear specifications upfront (Methods 2 & 4 excelled)
2. Request comprehensive testing regardless of methodology
3. Ask for multiple user interfaces and examples (Method 1's strength)
4. Emphasize documentation for long-term maintainability

---

## Limitations and Future Research

### Experiment Limitations
- Only one algorithmic challenge tested
- Single programming language (Python)
- AI agents may have different strengths than human developers
- **Methods 3 & 4 hit token limits**: This significantly impacted their implementations, making them appear less complete than they might have been with unlimited resources
- **Resource constraints affected methodology comparison**: TDD approaches required more tool interactions (54 vs 29), suggesting iterative methodologies are more resource-intensive for AI agents
- **Token limit bias**: Methods that completed early (1 & 2) had full resource allocation, while later methods (3 & 4) were constrained

### Recommended Future Experiments
1. **Language Comparison**: Same methodology across different programming languages
2. **Complexity Scaling**: Test methodologies on larger, multi-class systems
3. **Team Dynamics**: Compare methodologies with multiple AI agents collaborating
4. **Maintenance Simulation**: Test how easily each implementation accepts new features

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that **methodology matters** even in the AI era. Specification-first development (Method 2) produced the highest quality implementation with the best architecture, while direct implementation (Method 1) achieved excellent results with impressive speed.

**The key finding**: More sophisticated methodologies do produce better results, but the magnitude of improvement depends on project requirements. For production systems requiring robustness and maintainability, the extra investment in specifications and testing pays clear dividends. For rapid prototyping and experimentation, direct implementation remains highly effective.

**For practitioners**: Choose methodology based on project context - use specification-first for production systems, direct implementation for prototypes, and TDD approaches for learning and algorithm exploration.
