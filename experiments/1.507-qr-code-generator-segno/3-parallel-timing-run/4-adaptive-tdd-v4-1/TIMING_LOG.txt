QR CODE GENERATOR - METHOD 4 TIMING LOG
==========================================

Experiment: 1.507.3-qr-code-generator-segno-parallel
Method: 4 - Adaptive TDD V4.1
Tool Constraint: segno library

START TIME: 14:43:48
COMPLETION TIME: 14:50:36
TOTAL DURATION: 6m 48s

Development Timeline:
14:43:48 - START TIME: 14:43:48 - Adaptive TDD V4.1 Begin
14:44:11 - First failing test written
14:45:34 - First test passes - minimal implementation complete
14:46:17 - Input validation tests pass - basic validation implemented
14:47:31 - All core functionality tests pass - validation integrated
14:48:48 - All tests pass - design evolution complete
14:48:48 - FINISH TIME: Adaptive TDD V4.1 Complete
[Additional time for documentation and finalization: ~2m]

Adaptive TDD V4.1 Methodology:
- Start with simplest failing test
- Write minimal code to pass
- Add complexity incrementally
- Allow design to emerge naturally
- Refactor as patterns become clear
- Evolutionary approach to architecture

Design Evolution:
- Phase 1: Basic function existence
- Phase 2: Input validation integration
- Phase 3: Error handling and edge cases
- Phase 4: Full specification compliance
- Final: Clean, minimal implementation

RESULTS:
- Implementation: 71 lines of code (minimal, evolved design)
- Tests: Progressive test suite building complexity
- Functions: 2 (validate_input, generate_qr)
- Features: Specification compliance, UTF-8 support, error handling
- All tests passing, complete specification compliance
- Most concise implementation while meeting all requirements

NOTES:
- Longest development time: 6m 48s
- Evolutionary design approach
- Most concise final implementation (71 lines)
- Adaptive methodology allows natural emergence of design
- Slowest but produces most refined code architecture
