## Conclusion

Experiment 1.507.3 successfully demonstrated that **methodology choice dramatically impacts both development efficiency and code characteristics**. The **559% development time range** and **architectural variations** prove that matching methodology to project goals is critical for optimal outcomes.

The experimental design innovations - particularly severed branch isolation and parallel timing measurement - provide a robust framework for future methodology comparisons.

**Bottom Line**: There is no universally "best" methodology - each optimizes for different outcomes, and teams should choose based on their specific priorities and constraints.
