QR CODE GENERATOR - METHOD 3 TIMING LOG
==========================================

Experiment: 1.507.3-qr-code-generator-segno-parallel
Method: 3 - Test-First Development (TDD)
Tool Constraint: segno library

START TIME: 14:42:05
COMPLETION TIME: 14:43:05
TOTAL DURATION: 1m 0s

Development Timeline:
14:42:05 - Project setup initiated
14:42:15 - RED Phase 1: Initial tests written for validate_input
14:42:25 - RED Phase 1 CONFIRMED: Tests fail as expected (ModuleNotFoundError)
14:42:35 - GREEN Phase 1 PASSED: validate_input tests passing
14:42:45 - GREEN Phase 2 & 3 PASSED: All basic and edge case tests passing
14:42:50 - REFACTOR Phase: Improving code structure
14:42:55 - REFACTOR Phase COMPLETED: Code structure improved, all tests passing
14:43:00 - FINAL VALIDATION: Comprehensive testing and demo
14:43:05 - TDD METHOD COMPLETED: All cycles successful, implementation complete

TDD Methodology Applied:
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle followed strictly
- Tests written before implementation
- Minimal code to pass tests initially
- Refactoring phase improved structure
- Comprehensive test coverage throughout

RESULTS:
- Implementation: 152 lines of code (function-based with constants)
- Tests: Comprehensive test suite with TDD cycles
- Functions: 6 (validate_input, generate_qr, helper functions)
- Features: Directory creation, file verification, proper error handling
- All tests passing, complete specification compliance
- TDD methodology demonstrated effectively

NOTES:
- Fastest development time: 1m 0s
- Strict TDD adherence with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- Enhanced structure through refactoring phase
- Test-driven development approach highly efficient
