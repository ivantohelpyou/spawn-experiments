# Experiment 1.507.3: Parallel Timing Run

## Objective
Execute Methods 2, 3, and 4 in parallel using severed branch isolation with accurate timing measurement for methodology comparison.

## Methodology
- **Severed Branch Isolation**: Each method runs on completely isolated orphan branch
- **Parallel Execution**: All 3 methods run simultaneously for fair timing comparison
- **Timing Measurement**: Accurate start/end timestamps with detailed progression logs
- **Baseline Control**: Method 1 results used as baseline (4m 4s development time)

## Methods to Execute

### Method 2: Specification-driven Development
- **Branch**: `method-2-isolated-1507.3`
- **Approach**: Detailed spec analysis → design → implementation
- **Expected Characteristics**: Thorough validation, structured approach

### Method 3: Test-First Development (TDD)
- **Branch**: `method-3-isolated-1507.3`
- **Approach**: Write tests first → implement to pass tests
- **Expected Characteristics**: High test coverage, incremental development

### Method 4: Adaptive TDD V4.1
- **Branch**: `method-4-isolated-1507.3`
- **Approach**: Simple tests → minimal code → refactor → adapt
- **Expected Characteristics**: Evolutionary design, minimal viable implementation

## Success Criteria
- All methods complete with timing logs
- Comparable implementations meeting baseline specification
- Performance benchmarks for runtime comparison
- Complete methodology analysis with development time comparison

## Execution Protocol
1. Create parallel severed branches with baseline specification only
2. Launch Task agents simultaneously
3. Capture complete inline code from all agents
4. Measure and log development times accurately
5. Analyze and compare results across all 4 methods
