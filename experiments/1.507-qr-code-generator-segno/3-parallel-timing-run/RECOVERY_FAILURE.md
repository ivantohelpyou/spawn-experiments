# Experimental Failure: File Persistence Issue

**Date**: 2025-09-25

**Experiment**: 1.507-qr-code-generator-segno

## Issue Description
Despite Task agents returning complete code inline in their responses, the actual implementation files were not persisted to disk. This represents a **critical experimental failure**.

## Evidence
- Task responses contained complete qr_generator.py implementations
- Method folders exist but contain no implementation files
- Only __pycache__ directories and venv folders were found
- Git history shows no commits of the generated code

## Recovery Actions
1. ✅ Recreated Method 4 (Adaptive TDD V4.1) from Task response
2. ✅ Recreated Method 3 (TDD) from system reminders showing it was created
3. ❌ Method 1 and Method 2 implementations lost - need recreation

## Root Cause
**File system isolation** in Task tool execution:
- Task agents work in ephemeral environments
- Code generation occurs but files don't persist to actual experiment directories
- Only inline code in responses survives

## Protocol Implications
This validates the need for:
- **Mandatory inline code capture** in Task responses ✅
- **Immediate file recreation** from Task responses ✅
- **Git commit verification** after Task completion ❌
- **EXPERIMENTAL_PROTOCOL_V4** implementation ✅

## Status
- **Partial Recovery**: 2/4 methods recovered
- **Remaining Work**: Recreate Methods 1 & 2 from Task responses
- **Experimental Integrity**: Compromised but documented
