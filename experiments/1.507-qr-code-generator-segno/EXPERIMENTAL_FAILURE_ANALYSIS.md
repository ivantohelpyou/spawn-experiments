# Experimental Failure Analysis: Task Agent Code Capture

**Experiment 1.507** | **Date: September 25, 2025**

## Critical Failure Identified

**Problem**: Task agents successfully generated code, tests, and documentation but none of it was captured for examination.

### What Happened

1. **Task Agents Executed**: All 4 methodology agents ran successfully
2. **Code Generated**: Agents reported creating:
   - Implementation files (qr_generator.py)
   - Test suites (test_qr_generator.py, etc.)
   - Documentation (README.md, specs)
   - Demo scripts
3. **Nothing Persisted**: Files exist only in agent ephemeral environments
4. **Branches Created**: Git branches exist but contain no commits
5. **No Code Available**: Cannot examine, verify, or compare actual implementations

### Impact on Experiment

- **Research Validity**: Cannot verify methodology patterns claimed by agents
- **Code Quality**: No way to assess actual implementation quality
- **Test Coverage**: Cannot verify test comprehensiveness
- **Feature Comparison**: No ability to compare segno integration approaches
- **Reproducibility**: Experiment cannot be independently verified

## Root Cause Analysis

### Task Tool Architecture Issue

The Task tool runs agents in isolated environments where:
- File writes occur in agent-local filesystems
- Git operations partially work (branch creation)
- No mechanism to persist files back to main environment
- Agent reports are text-only summaries

### Missing Design Elements

1. **No Code Capture Mechanism**: Task prompt didn't require code inclusion in response
2. **No Periodic Commits**: Agents weren't instructed to commit frequently
3. **No Artifact Collection**: No process to gather generated files
4. **No Verification Step**: No check that code was actually accessible

## Failed Atomic Commit Protocol

The agents were instructed to:
```
ATOMIC COMMIT PROTOCOL:
- git add -A && git commit -m "Initial: Starting implementation"
- git add -A && git commit -m "Core: Basic functionality working"
- git add -A && git commit -m "COMPLETE: Working solution"
```

But these commits either:
- Happened in isolated environments
- Failed silently
- Were not pushed/merged back

## Solution Design

### Option 1: Inline Code Capture (Immediate Fix)

Modify Task agent prompts to include:
```
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Include all generated code in your response.

After creating each file, include it in your response:

```python
# FILE: experiments/1.507/method-1/qr_generator.py
[complete file contents]
```

```python
# FILE: experiments/1.507/method-1/test_qr_generator.py
[complete test file contents]
```
```

### Option 2: Competitive Injection Pattern (Proven Solution)

As mentioned, we had success with competitive injection where agents:
1. Create files locally
2. Commit to repo periodically
3. Push to branch
4. Report commit SHAs

Example prompt addition:
```
CHECKPOINT REQUIREMENT: Every 5 minutes, commit and report:
1. git add -A
2. git commit -m "Checkpoint: [current progress]"
3. git push origin [branch-name]
4. Report commit SHA in your response
```

### Option 3: Artifact Collection Protocol

Post-execution artifact gathering:
```
END OF TASK REQUIREMENT:
1. Create a code bundle:
   tar -czf method_X_bundle.tar.gz experiments/1.507/method-X/
2. Base64 encode and include in response:
   base64 method_X_bundle.tar.gz
3. Include file listing with line counts
```

## Recommended Approach

### Hybrid Solution: Code + Commits + Verification

```markdown
EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL V2:

1. INLINE CODE CAPTURE:
   - Include all code files in response
   - Use markdown code blocks with file paths

2. PERIODIC COMMITS:
   - Commit every major milestone
   - Report commit SHA
   - Verify commits are accessible

3. FINAL VERIFICATION:
   - List all created files with sizes
   - Run test suite and include output
   - Generate metrics (LOC, test count, etc.)
```

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Insights

1. **Agent Output != Persistent Artifacts**: Task agents work in isolation
2. **Git Operations Partially Work**: Branches created but no commits
3. **Explicit Capture Required**: Must explicitly request code in response
4. **Verification Essential**: Need to verify artifacts are accessible

### Framework Improvements Needed

1. **Update META_PROMPT_GENERATOR**: Add artifact capture requirements
2. **Enhance Task Prompts**: Include inline code capture
3. **Add Verification Step**: Check files exist before marking complete
4. **Document Limitation**: Add to framework documentation

## Experimental Recovery

### For Experiment 1.507

Since we cannot recover the actual code:
1. **Document Pattern Claims**: Record what agents reported
2. **Mark as Partial Failure**: Note limitation in final report
3. **Re-run with Fixed Protocol**: Execute again with proper capture

### Updated Experiment Status

- **Research Questions**: Partially answered based on agent reports
- **Code Comparison**: ❌ Not possible
- **Methodology Patterns**: ✅ Inferred from reports
- **External Tool Impact**: ✅ Time impact confirmed
- **Reproducibility**: ❌ Cannot reproduce without code

## Prevention Protocol

### For Future Experiments

```python
def verify_experiment_artifacts(experiment_num, method_name):
    """Verify all artifacts are accessible post-execution."""

    checks = {
        'implementation_exists': False,
        'tests_exist': False,
        'commits_accessible': False,
        'code_readable': False
    }

    # Check implementation file
    impl_path = f"experiments/{experiment_num}/{method_name}/implementation.py"
    checks['implementation_exists'] = os.path.exists(impl_path)

    # Check test files
    test_pattern = f"experiments/{experiment_num}/{method_name}/test_*.py"
    checks['tests_exist'] = len(glob.glob(test_pattern)) > 0

    # Check git commits
    result = subprocess.run(['git', 'log', '--oneline', '-1'], capture_output=True)
    checks['commits_accessible'] = result.returncode == 0

    # Verify code readable
    if checks['implementation_exists']:
        with open(impl_path) as f:
            checks['code_readable'] = len(f.read()) > 0

    return all(checks.values()), checks
```

## Conclusion

**Critical Failure**: Experiment 1.507 suffered from a fundamental design flaw where generated code was not captured.

**Root Cause**: Task agent isolation and missing artifact capture requirements.

**Solution**: Implement hybrid approach with inline code capture, periodic commits, and verification.

**Action Items**:
1. ✅ Document failure (this document)
2. ⬜ Update Task agent prompts for future experiments
3. ⬜ Re-run 1.507 with fixed protocol
4. ⬜ Update framework documentation

This failure provides valuable learning about Task agent limitations and the importance of explicit artifact capture in distributed agent execution.
