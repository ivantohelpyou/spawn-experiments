## Key Innovations Discovered

1. **Test Validation Pattern** (Method 4): Writing incorrect implementations to validate test quality proved highly valuable for ensuring robust test suites.

2. **Specification-to-Code Ratio** (Method 2): The 196-line specification for a 231-line implementation highlights the importance of specification appropriateness.

3. **Natural Feature Discovery** (Method 1): Without specifications, the implementation naturally included useful utilities like statistics and demos.

4. **TDD Minimalism** (Method 3): Achieved the same functionality with 65% less code than Method 2, demonstrating TDD's efficiency.

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that for Tier 1 algorithmic problems:

1. **Method 3 (TDD)** provides the best balance of speed, quality, and maintainability for most scenarios.

2. **Method 1 (Immediate)** excels at rapid prototyping and naturally discovers useful features.

3. **Method 2 (Specification-Driven)** risks over-engineering simple problems but ensures completeness.

4. **Method 4 (Validated Testing)** provides maximum confidence but with time overhead that may not be justified for simple functions.

The experiment confirms that methodology choice should align with problem complexity. For simple algorithmic functions, lighter-weight approaches (Methods 1 & 3) often provide better ROI than comprehensive approaches (Methods 2 & 4).

## Implications for AI-Assisted Development

1. **AI models can effectively follow different methodologies** when given clear instructions
2. **Specification detail should match problem complexity** to avoid over-engineering
3. **Test validation adds value** even for AI-generated code
4. **TDD discipline works well** with AI assistants, producing clean, tested code efficiently
5. **Immediate implementation** with AI can quickly produce feature-rich solutions

This Tier 1 experiment successfully demonstrates how different methodologies scale for simple algorithmic problems, setting a baseline for comparison with more complex Tier 2 and Tier 3 experiments.
