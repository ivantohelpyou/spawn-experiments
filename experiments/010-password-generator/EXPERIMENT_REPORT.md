## Limitations and Considerations

### Experimental Limitations

1. **Single problem domain** - Results may not generalize to all software types
2. **AI agent execution** - Human developers might show different patterns
3. **Time pressure absence** - Real-world constraints might change outcomes
4. **Solo development** - Team dynamics not considered

### Contextual Factors

- **Problem complexity**: Simple password generator may favor direct approaches
- **Developer experience**: Senior developers might excel with Method 1, juniors with Method 2/3
- **Domain familiarity**: Well-known problems might not require extensive planning
- **Quality requirements**: Safety-critical systems might mandate test-driven approaches

## Future Research Directions

1. **Scale the experiment** to more complex applications (web services, databases)
2. **Test with human developers** to validate AI agent findings
3. **Measure long-term maintainability** through follow-up modification tasks
4. **Explore hybrid approaches** combining benefits of multiple methods
5. **Investigate domain-specific effectiveness** (web dev vs. systems programming vs. data science)

## Conclusion

This experiment reveals that **methodology effectiveness is highly context-dependent**. Rather than declaring a single "best" approach, results suggest:

1. **Simple problems benefit from direct implementation** (Method 1)
2. **Complex systems require architectural planning** (Method 2)
3. **Critical systems need comprehensive testing** (Methods 3/4)
4. **Test validation innovation shows promise** (Method 4)

The most significant finding is that **AI-assisted development may reduce the traditional advantages of heavyweight methodologies** for simple problems, while **validated testing approaches offer genuine innovation** in software quality assurance.

For the AI era of development, **adaptive methodology selection** based on problem context, team expertise, and quality requirements appears more valuable than rigid adherence to any single approach.
