# Password Generator Experiment

## Objective
Compare four different software development methodologies for building a simple password generator using Python standard library only.

## Application Type
Simple Password Generator - A command-line tool that generates secure passwords with customizable options.

## Technology Stack
Python (standard library only)

## Core Requirements
- Generate passwords of configurable length
- Support different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Include/exclude similar-looking characters option
- Command-line interface
- Password strength validation
- Multiple password generation in single run

## Methodology Comparison
This experiment tests four approaches:
1. **Immediate Implementation** - Direct coding approach
2. **Specification-Driven** - Requirements-first development
3. **Test-First Development** - Traditional TDD approach
4. **Validated Test Development** - Enhanced TDD with test validation

## Success Criteria
- Functional password generator meeting all requirements
- Code quality and maintainability assessment
- Development time comparison
- Test coverage analysis (where applicable)

## Expected Duration
15-60 minutes per method
