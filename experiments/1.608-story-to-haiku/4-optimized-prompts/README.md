## Optimized Prompt Features

All methods include:

✅ **Explicit Syllable Instructions**
```
SYLLABLE COUNTING:
- Count each syllable carefully (e.g., "beautiful" = beau-ti-ful = 3 syllables)
- Verify your counts before finalizing
- Line 1: Exactly 5 syllables
- Line 2: Exactly 7 syllables
- Line 3: Exactly 5 syllables
```

✅ **Concrete Example**
```json
{
  "lines": [
    "Fog wraps the shoreline",
    "Old hands cast nets through the mist",
    "Sea holds its secrets"
  ],
  "syllables": [5, 7, 5],
  "essence": "The timeless ritual of fishing in mysterious morning fog"
}
```

✅ **Essence Guidance**
- "Capture the essence of the story in a single vivid moment"

✅ **Structured JSON Format**
- Clear output schema with examples

## Usage

### Run Olympic Judging

```bash
# Navigate to run 4
cd 4-optimized-prompts

# Run Olympic judging (3 judge models)
python olympic_judging_demo.py --run 4

# This will:
# 1. Generate haiku from all 4 methods with real Ollama
# 2. Have 3 judge models (llama3.2, phi3:mini, gemma2:2b) evaluate them
# 3. Drop highest/lowest scores and average
# 4. Declare winner by aesthetic quality
```

### Use CLI Tool

```bash
# Generate from top methods (Run 4)
../tools/generate-haiku "Your story here" --run 4

# Top 3 only
../tools/generate-haiku "Your story here" --run 4 --top 3

# All 4 methods
../tools/generate-haiku "Your story here" --run 4 --all
```

### Run Individual Method Tests

```bash
# Method 1
cd 1-immediate-implementation
pytest test_haiku_converter.py -v

# Method 2
cd 2-specification-driven
pytest test_haiku_converter.py -v

# Method 3
cd 3-test-first-development
pytest test_haiku_converter.py -v

# Method 4 (with coverage)
cd 4-adaptive-tdd
pytest test_haiku_converter.py --cov=haiku_converter --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Research Questions

### 1. Do optimized prompts improve haiku quality?
**Status**: Requires Olympic judging comparison with Run 3

### 2. Do all methods benefit equally from better prompts?
**Status**: Code structure analysis complete, aesthetic comparison pending

### 3. Does prompt quality affect development time?
**Answer**: YES - All methods were faster than Run 3
- Clearer prompts reduced ambiguity
- Less rework needed

### 4. Does validation amplify prompt benefits?
**Answer**: YES - Method 4 showed biggest improvement (+5 points)
- Validation cycles ensure prompt quality
- Test coverage for prompt elements
- Scientific rigor pays off

## Key Findings

1. **All methods successfully implemented optimized prompts** without losing their core identity

2. **Development speed improved** across all methods (clearer requirements = faster coding)

3. **Method 4 (Adaptive TDD) gained most** from optimized prompts (+5 points vs Run 3)

4. **Only Method 4 validates prompt quality** through tests:
   - 5 tests specifically for prompt elements
   - Verified presence of examples, rules, guidance

5. **Prompt extraction varies**:
   - Method 1: Inline (fast but less flexible)
   - Methods 2, 3, 4: Extracted helpers (modular, testable)

## Next Steps

### 1. Olympic Judging Evaluation
```bash
python olympic_judging_demo.py --run 4
```
Compare aesthetic scores with Run 3 to determine if optimized prompts improve haiku quality.

### 2. Cross-Run Comparison
Compare Run 4 (optimized) vs Run 3 (baseline) for each method:
- Method 1: Run 4 vs Run 3
- Method 2: Run 4 vs Run 3
- Method 3: Run 4 vs Run 3
- Method 4: Run 4 vs Run 3

### 3. Prompt Optimization Analysis
Document which prompt elements had most impact:
- Explicit syllable instructions?
- Concrete examples?
- Essence guidance?
- Structured format?

### 4. Update META_PROMPT_GENERATOR_V5
Incorporate learnings:
- Prompt engineering best practices
- Validation benefits for prompt quality
- Time investment vs quality tradeoffs
