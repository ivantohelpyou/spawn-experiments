# Method 3: Pure TDD / Test-First Development
## Story-to-Haiku Converter - Run 4 (Optimized Prompts)

**Implementation Date**: 2025-09-30
**Method**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Red-Green-Refactor

**Run**: 4 of 4 - Optimized Prompts with Enhanced Prompt Engineering

---

## Overview

This implementation follows **Pure Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles where tests are written FIRST, before any implementation code. The approach ensures that the code is driven by requirements, maintainable, and thoroughly tested.

### TDD Philosophy

> "Write a test, watch it fail, write just enough code to make it pass, refactor if needed, repeat."

The TDD cycle followed:
1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

---

## TDD Process Documentation

### Phase 1: RED - Write Tests First

**File Created**: `test_haiku_converter.py` (written BEFORE `haiku_converter.py`)

#### Test Categories Written

1. **Basic Functionality Tests** (6 tests)
   - âœ… Returns dict with required keys
   - âœ… Valid haiku structure (5-7-5)
   - âœ… Haiku string formatting with newlines
   - âœ… Lines array has 3 elements
   - âœ… Essence extraction
   - âœ… Syllable validation

2. **Invalid Syllables Tests** (3 tests)
   - âœ… Invalid first line syllables detected
   - âœ… Invalid second line syllables detected
   - âœ… Invalid third line syllables detected

3. **Edge Cases Tests** (6 tests)
   - âœ… Empty input raises error
   - âœ… Whitespace-only input raises error
   - âœ… Malformed JSON raises error
   - âœ… Missing required keys raises error
   - âœ… Wrong number of lines raises error
   - âœ… Wrong number of syllable counts raises error

4. **Prompt Optimization Tests** (3 tests - Run 4 specific)
   - âœ… Prompt includes explicit syllable instructions
   - âœ… Prompt includes example format
   - âœ… Prompt includes essence guidance

5. **LLM Integration Tests** (3 tests)
   - âœ… Accepts custom LLM client
   - âœ… LLM called with correct model (llama3.2)
   - âœ… LLM called with JSON format

6. **Real-World Scenarios** (3 tests)
   - âœ… Long story input
   - âœ… Short story input
   - âœ… Story with strong emotion

**Total Tests Written**: 24 comprehensive tests

#### Test Design Principles

- **Mocking Strategy**: Used `unittest.mock` to create mock LLM responses
- **Mock Response Structure**: Created `MockLLMResponse` class to mimic `ollama.chat()` structure
- **Fast Execution**: All tests run in milliseconds using mocks (no real LLM calls)
- **Dependency Injection**: Tests inject mock clients via `llm_client` parameter
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions

### Phase 2: Confirm Tests Fail (RED Phase Validation)

```bash
python -m pytest test_haiku_converter.py -v
```

**Expected Result**: All tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'haiku_converter'`

This confirms we're starting from RED (failing tests).

### Phase 3: GREEN - Implement Code

**File Created**: `haiku_converter.py` (written AFTER tests)

#### Implementation Approach

The implementation was written to satisfy test requirements with:
- **Minimal code**: No unnecessary features
- **Clear structure**: Single responsibility functions
- **Error handling**: Proper validation and error messages
- **Dependency injection**: Supports mock clients for testing

#### Key Implementation Details

1. **Function Signature**
```python
def story_to_haiku(text: str, llm_client=None) -> dict
```

2. **Optimized Prompt Engineering** (Run 4 Enhancement)
   - Created `_build_optimized_prompt()` helper function
   - Explicit syllable counting instructions for each line
   - Clear example with syllable breakdown
   - Guidance on essence extraction
   - Structured JSON format specification

3. **Validation Logic**
   - Input validation (empty/whitespace check)
   - JSON parsing with error handling
   - Required keys validation
   - Structure validation (3 lines, 3 syllable counts)
   - Syllable pattern validation (5-7-5)

4. **Return Structure**
```python
{
    'haiku': str,       # Complete haiku with newlines
    'lines': list[str], # Three lines
    'syllables': list[int], # [5, 7, 5]
    'essence': str,     # Captured theme
    'valid': bool       # True if 5-7-5 pattern
}
```

### Phase 4: Confirm Tests Pass (GREEN Phase Validation)

After implementation, run tests again:

```bash
python -m pytest test_haiku_converter.py -v
```

**Expected Result**: All 24 tests pass

This confirms we've reached GREEN (passing tests).

### Phase 5: REFACTOR (If Needed)

In this implementation:
- Code is already clean and minimal
- Prompt building extracted to separate function for clarity
- No further refactoring needed at this stage
- Tests remain green throughout

---

## Run 4: Optimized Prompts Enhancement

### What's Different in Run 4?

This implementation uses **enhanced prompt engineering** compared to Run 3:

#### Explicit Syllable Instructions
```
SYLLABLE COUNTING:
- Count each syllable carefully (e.g., "beautiful" = beau-ti-ful = 3 syllables)
- Verify your counts before finalizing
- First line must have exactly 5 syllables
- Second line must have exactly 7 syllables
- Third line must have exactly 5 syllables
```

#### Clear Example Format
Includes a complete example showing:
- Input story
- Output haiku with exact syllable structure
- Essence explanation

#### Essence Extraction Guidance
```
ESSENCE EXTRACTION:
- Identify the core emotion, theme, or image from the story
- Distill the story's essence into a single vivid moment or feeling
- Capture what makes this story meaningful
```

### Hypothesis

Better prompts should lead to:
1. More accurate syllable counting by the LLM
2. Higher quality haiku poetry
3. Better essence capture
4. Improved Olympic judging scores
