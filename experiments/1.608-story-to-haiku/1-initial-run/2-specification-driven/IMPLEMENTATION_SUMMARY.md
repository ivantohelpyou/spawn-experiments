## Design Decisions

### 1. Specification-First Approach
**Decision**: Write complete technical specification before any implementation

**Rationale**:
- Provides clear roadmap for implementation
- Considers all edge cases upfront
- Results in production-ready code from the start
- Creates living documentation

**Outcome**: Implementation was straightforward, following the spec exactly. No refactoring needed.

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling
**Decision**: Handle all error cases with clear, actionable messages

**Rationale**:
- Production-ready code must handle failures gracefully
- Users need clear feedback on what went wrong
- Specification phase identified all potential failure points

**Outcome**: Three error types with specific messages:
- `ValueError` for input validation (empty, whitespace)
- `ValueError` for invalid LLM responses (wrong line count)
- `RuntimeError` for LLM generation failures

### 3. Dependency Injection Pattern
**Decision**: Accept optional `llm_client` parameter

**Rationale**:
- Enables fast testing with mocks (no Ollama required)
- Follows SOLID principles (Dependency Inversion)
- Allows parallel test execution
- Makes code more maintainable

**Outcome**: All tests run in <1 second with mocks. No Ollama needed for development.

### 4. Syllable Counting Algorithm
**Decision**: Use vowel-cluster counting (not dictionary lookup)

**Rationale**:
- No external dependencies
- Fast execution (~85% accurate)
- Good enough for validation
- Specified in detail before implementation

**Outcome**: Simple, effective algorithm that handles most cases correctly.

### 5. Input Truncation (500 chars)
**Decision**: Limit LLM input to 500 characters

**Rationale**:
- Haiku captures essence, not full details
- Prevents token limit issues
- Faster generation
- Clearer prompts for LLM

**Outcome**: Works well in practice; LLM focuses on core concepts.

## Methodology Analysis

### Method 2: Specification-Driven

#### Process Followed
1. **Phase 1: Comprehensive Specification** (~2.5 minutes)
   - Created 592-line technical specification
   - Designed complete architecture

4. LLM Invocation
5. Response Parsing
6. Syllable Validation
7. Result Structure
```

### 2. Comprehensive Error Messages

"Expected 3 haiku lines, got 2. LLM response may be malformed."
"LLM generation failed: [error details]"
```

### 3. Mock Testing Pattern
```python
# Easy to create mocks for testing
mock_llm = Mock()
mock_llm.generate.return_value = {'response': haiku_text}
result = story_to_haiku(text, llm_client=mock_llm)
```

### 4. Type Hints Throughout
```python
def story_to_haiku(text: str, llm_client: Optional[Any] = None) -> dict:
def count_syllables(word: str) -> int:
def extract_essence(text: str) -> str:
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Specification clarity**: Having complete spec eliminated implementation uncertainty
2. **Error handling design**: Thinking through all failure modes upfront paid off
3. **Test planning**: Mock strategy specified before implementation worked perfectly
4. **Documentation**: Specification serves as excellent reference documentation

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Time vs. value**: For simple functions, full specification may be overkill
2. **Flexibility**: Harder to adapt to changing requirements mid-implementation
3. **Iteration**: No opportunity to learn from implementation before design

### When to Use This Method
- **Production systems** requiring robustness
- **Complex features** with many edge cases
- **Team projects** needing clear documentation
- **Long-term maintenance** projects
- When **upfront clarity** is more valuable than **rapid iteration**

### When NOT to Use This Method
- **Simple, straightforward tasks** (specification overhead not justified)
- **Exploratory development** (need to learn as you go)
- **Rapidly changing requirements** (specification becomes outdated)
- **Time-critical prototypes** (faster methods more appropriate)

## Conclusion

The specification-driven implementation successfully delivered a **production-ready, well-documented, comprehensively tested** story-to-haiku converter. The upfront investment in design paid off with clean implementation, complete error handling, and excellent documentation.

**Key Success Factors**:
- Complete technical specification guided implementation
- No refactoring needed; implemented correctly first time
- All edge cases handled from the start
