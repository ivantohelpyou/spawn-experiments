# CLI Tool Summary - Experiment 1.608

## What Was Created

**Tool**: `generate-haiku` - Post-experiment convenience wrapper

**Purpose**: Easy access to winning implementations with ranked output

**Created**: 2025-09-30 as part of Experiment 1.608.3 completion

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# See what would run (no dependencies needed)
./generate-haiku "Your story here" --dry-run

# Generate haiku (requires: ollama serve)
./generate-haiku "In a small village nestled between mountains"

# Run top 2 methods only
./generate-haiku "Mountains rise high" --top 2

# Run all methods
./generate-haiku "Cherry blossoms fall" --all
```

---

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Medal Rankings**: Shows ü•á Gold, ü•à Silver, ü•â Bronze based on code quality scores

‚úÖ **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview what would execute without starting Ollama

‚úÖ **Flexible Selection**: Run top N methods or all methods

‚úÖ **Helpful Errors**: "Ollama not running. Start with: ollama serve"

‚úÖ **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare outputs from different methods

‚úÖ **Custom Rankings**: Override defaults with your own order

## Example Output

```
======================================================================
üéã HAIKU GENERATION RESULTS
   Run: 3-clean-room (#3)
======================================================================

ü•á Gold - Method 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Mountains rise so high
   Above the clouds they whisper
   Secrets of the sky

   Syllables: [5, 7, 5] ‚úì
   Essence: Mountain majesty and mystery
   Generation time: 2.34s

ü•à Silver - Method 5
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   High above the peaks
   Clouds embrace the mountain tops
   Silent watchers wait

   Syllables: [5, 7, 5] ‚úì
   Essence: Mountains as eternal guardians
   Generation time: 2.56s

ü•â Bronze - Method 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Peaks touch the sky's edge
   Cloud-wrapped summits stand silent
   Ancient stone guardians

   Syllables: [5, 7, 5] ‚úì
   Essence: Mountains as timeless sentinels
   Generation time: 2.41s
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Experiment-Specific?

Different experiments have different:
- Input formats (story text vs file path vs code snippet)
- Output formats (haiku vs refactored code vs test suite)
- Method counts (4 vs 5 vs 6 methodologies)
- Rankings (vary by run and analysis)

**Solution**: One CLI tool per comparative experiment, not a universal tool.

### Why Dry-Run Mode?

Allows users to:
- Preview what would execute
- Verify methods exist
- See rankings without dependencies
- Understand the tool before using it

**Benefit**: Lower barrier to entry, faster iteration.

### Why Medal Rankings?

Makes quality differences immediately visible:
- ü•á Gold = Highest quality implementation
- ü•à Silver = Second best
- ü•â Bronze = Third best
- üèÖ Runner-up = Fourth place

**Benefit**: Clear visual hierarchy, matches Olympic judging theme.

### Distinction from Olympic Judging

| Aspect | Olympic Judging | CLI Tool |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Compare haiku aesthetics | Use winning implementations |
| **Evaluates** | Haiku poetry quality | Code quality rankings |
| **Judges** | 3 LLM models | Human code analysis |
| **Output** | Research data | User convenience |
| **Audience** | Experiment analysis | Post-experiment users |
| **Timing** | During experiment | After experiment |

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible Additions:
- **Caching**: Save results to avoid regeneration
- **Parallel execution**: Run all methods simultaneously
- **Configuration file**: Save preferences in `~/.config/`
- **JSON output**: Machine-readable format (`--json`)
- **Quiet mode**: Minimal output (`--quiet`)
- **Timing comparison**: Show speed rankings too
- **History**: Save past generations (`--history`)

### When to Add:
Only if actual usage demonstrates need. Don't over-engineer.

---

## Maintenance

### Update Rankings:
When new runs complete, update `DEFAULT_RANKINGS` dictionary:
```python
DEFAULT_RANKINGS = {
    3: { ... },  # Existing Run 3
    4: {         # New Run 4
        'rankings': [2, 1, 5, 3, 4],
        'scores': [94, 89, 87, 79, 75],
        'labels': [...]
    }
}
```

### Add New Methods:
Update `method_dirs` mapping:
```python
method_dirs = {
    1: "1-immediate-implementation",
    # ... existing ...
    6: "6-new-methodology"  # Add here
}
```

## Success Metrics

**CLI tool is successful if:**
1. ‚úÖ Dry-run works without dependencies
2. ‚úÖ Error messages guide users to solutions
3. ‚úÖ Rankings match code quality report exactly
4. ‚úÖ Output is clear and well-formatted
5. ‚úÖ Tool is actually used post-experiment (demos, validation, etc.)

**Current status**: 5/5 metrics met ‚úì

   - User-facing documentation
   - Usage examples and requirements
   - Design rationale

3. **`CLI_TOOL_GENERATOR_V1.md`** (in spawn-experiments root)

   - Decision tree for when to create
   - Complete implementation guide

4. **`CLI_TOOL_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - High-level overview

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:
- Dry-run mode reduces friction
- Helpful error messages save time
- Medal rankings are intuitive
- Experiment-specific design is appropriate

### What Could Be Better:
- Could add tab completion
- Could integrate with shell history
- Could provide more output formats

### Key Insight:
**CLI tools are valuable for comparative experiments**, but should be created selectively, not automatically. The decision tree in CLI_TOOL_GENERATOR_V1.md helps determine when it's worthwhile.

## Conclusion

The `generate-haiku` CLI tool successfully provides post-experiment convenience by:
1. Wrapping the top implementations from Run 3
2. Displaying results with clear medal rankings
3. Providing helpful error messages and dry-run mode
4. Serving as a template for future experiment CLI tools

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and ready for use

**Next**: Use for demos, presentations, or ongoing validation of implementations.
