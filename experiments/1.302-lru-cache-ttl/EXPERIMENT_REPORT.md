### Reliability Considerations
- Results specific to LRU+TTL algorithmic problem
- May not generalize to UI, database, or integration tasks
- Agent capabilities may differ from human developers
- Time measurements precise but sample size limited

## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **No Universal Winner**: Each methodology excelled in different dimensions
2. **Speed ≠ Quality**: Fastest method (Specification-Driven) also produced high quality
3. **Feature Scope Matters**: Problem interpretation varied significantly between methods
4. **Test Quality Varies**: Different approaches to testing revealed different aspects

### Methodology Effectiveness Summary

- **Immediate Implementation**: Best for rapid prototyping and feature-rich solutions
- **Specification-Driven**: Best overall balance of speed, quality, and documentation

- **Validated Test Development**: Best for high-assurance, critical systems

### Future Research Directions

1. **Scaling Studies**: How do results change with larger, more complex problems?
2. **Maintenance Phase**: Which methodology produces most maintainable code over time?
3. **Team Dynamics**: How do results vary with multiple developers?
4. **Domain Specificity**: Do results differ for UI, algorithms, databases, etc.?

### Meta-Learning

The experiment itself demonstrated the value of:
- **Neutral experimental design** preventing confirmation bias
- **Parallel execution** enabling objective comparison
- **Automated setup** ensuring consistent conditions
- **Comprehensive measurement** capturing multiple quality dimensions

**The goal was objective measurement, not methodology validation - and the results provide genuine insights into trade-offs rather than confirming preconceptions.**
