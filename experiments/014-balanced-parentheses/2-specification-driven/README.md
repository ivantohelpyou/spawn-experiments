# Experiment 014: Balanced Parentheses Checker - Specification-Driven Development

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates specification-driven development by creating a comprehensive specification before implementing a balanced parentheses checker in Python.

## Timing
- **Start Time**: 5:29:36 PM PDT
- **End Time**: 5:31:37 PM PDT
- **Total Duration**: ~2 minutes 1 second

## Approach: Specification-Driven Development

This approach follows a rigorous specification-first methodology:

1. **Comprehensive Specification**: Created detailed requirements document first
2. **Implementation**: Built solution strictly according to specification
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite based on specification requirements
4. **Validation**: All tests pass, confirming specification compliance

## Files Created

### `/home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments/experiments/014-balanced-parentheses/2-specification-driven/SPECIFICATION.md`
- Complete functional requirements
- Detailed validation logic and nesting rules
- Comprehensive edge cases and error conditions
- Performance requirements and API specification
- Test categories and validation criteria

### `/home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments/experiments/014-balanced-parentheses/2-specification-driven/balanced_parentheses.py`
- Main implementation with `is_balanced()` function
- Additional `get_balance_info()` diagnostic function
- Complete type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling and input validation
- Built strictly according to specification

### `/home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments/experiments/014-balanced-parentheses/2-specification-driven/test_balanced_parentheses.py`
- 23 comprehensive test cases covering all specification requirements
- Performance tests verifying O(n) time complexity
- Input validation tests
- Edge case and error condition tests
- Specification compliance verification

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- Validates balanced parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`
- Proper nesting validation (no interleaving)
- Type consistency checking
- Non-bracket character handling

### Advanced Features
- Comprehensive error reporting with `get_balance_info()`
- Position tracking for debugging
- Performance optimized for large inputs
- Robust input validation

### Test Coverage
- **Basic functionality**: Empty strings, single pairs, sequences
- **Nesting scenarios**: Proper nesting, invalid patterns, deep nesting
- **Edge cases**: Non-bracket characters, large strings, mixed content
- **Error conditions**: Unmatched brackets, type mismatches, wrong order
- **Performance**: Linear time complexity verification
- **Input validation**: Type checking and error handling

## Test Results
```
Tests run: 23
Failures: 0
Errors: 0
Overall result: PASS
```

All tests pass successfully, confirming the implementation meets specification requirements.

## Algorithm Details

**Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is string length
**Space Complexity**: O(k) where k is maximum nesting depth
**Algorithm**: Stack-based bracket matching

## Specification-Driven Benefits

1. **Clear Requirements**: Comprehensive specification eliminates ambiguity
2. **Complete Coverage**: All edge cases identified upfront
3. **Quality Assurance**: Tests directly derived from specification
4. **Maintainability**: Clear documentation for future modifications
5. **Validation**: Easy to verify implementation correctness

## Demo Output
```
"" -> True
"()" -> True
"([{}])" -> True
"([)]" -> False (Bracket type mismatch)
"(((" -> False (Unmatched opening brackets)
")))" -> False (Unmatched closing bracket)
"hello(world)" -> True
"a[b{c}d]e" -> True
```

## Conclusion

The specification-driven approach produced a robust, well-documented solution with comprehensive test coverage. The upfront investment in detailed specification pays dividends in implementation clarity, test completeness, and overall code quality. All requirements were met successfully within approximately 2 minutes.
