SEVERED BRANCH TIMING - METHOD 2: SPECIFICATION-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
================================================================

Experiment: 2.505.2-severed-branch-timing
Method: 2 - Specification-driven Development
Task: JSON Schema Validator CLI (identical to 2.505)

START TIME: 2025-09-25 16:42:30 UTC
END TIME: 2025-09-25 16:47:35 UTC
TOTAL DURATION: 5 minutes 5 seconds

Specification-Driven Development Process:
1. Deep Specification Analysis (1 min): Thoroughly analyzed requirements and identified all functional and non-functional requirements
2. Architectural Design (30 sec): Designed modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
3. Systematic Implementation (3 min): Implemented modules in logical order following design principles
4. Comprehensive Testing (1 min 30 sec): Created test cases and validated all functionality

ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTED:
- main.py: CLI argument parsing and command routing
- validator.py: Core JSON Schema validation functionality
- batch.py: Batch processing with progress indicators
- utils.py: Utility functions for file operations
- formatters.py: Output formatting (text, JSON, CSV)
- schema_checker.py: Schema validity checking

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ JSON data and schema file input support
✅ Detailed validation error reporting with paths
✅ Batch validation of multiple files
✅ Multiple output formats (text, JSON, CSV)
✅ Progress indicators for batch operations
✅ Dry-run mode for schema checking
✅ JSON Schema Draft 7 support
✅ Comprehensive format validation (email, date, uri)
✅ CLI with proper argument parsing
✅ Error handling with meaningful messages
✅ stdin support
✅ Wildcard file pattern support

METHODOLOGY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Most structured and methodical approach
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns
- Professional-grade implementation patterns
