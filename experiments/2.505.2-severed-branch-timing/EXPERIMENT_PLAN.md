# Experiment 2.505.2: Severed Branch Timing Comparison

## Objective
**Test the hypothesis that severed branch isolation accelerates development across ALL methodologies** by comparing identical tasks with and without clean-slate conditions.

## Controlled Comparison Design
- **Control Group**: Original 2.505 (JSON Schema Validator CLI) with normal development context
- **Test Group**: 2.505.2 with severed branch isolation (clean room protocol)
- **Identical Task**: JSON Schema Validator CLI with same baseline specification
- **Same Methods**: 4 methodologies (Immediate, Specification-driven, TDD, Adaptive TDD V4.1)

## Hypothesis
**Severed branch isolation reduces development time across ALL methods** by eliminating:
- Context analysis overhead
- Existing codebase scanning
- Architectural decision paralysis
- Component discovery complexity

## Expected Results
If hypothesis is correct, we should see:
1. **Uniform acceleration**: All 4 methods faster in 2.505.2
2. **Preserved ratios**: Methodology ranking remains similar
3. **Quantifiable benefit**: Measurable time reduction percentage

## Baseline Data (Original 2.505)
| Method | Original Time | Ranking |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Method 1 (Immediate) | 4m 15s | ðŸ¥‡ Fastest |
| Method 4 (Adaptive TDD) | 5m 14s | ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd |
| Method 2 (Specification) | 11m 2s | ðŸ¥‰ 3rd |
| Method 3 (TDD) | 11m 18s | 4th |

**Original Time Range**: 4m 15s - 11m 18s (2.7x difference)

## Methodology
1. **Severed Branch Isolation**: Each method runs on completely isolated orphan branch
2. **Parallel Execution**: All 4 methods run simultaneously for fair comparison
3. **Identical Specification**: Same baseline requirements as original 2.505
4. **Clean Room Protocol**: Zero access to existing implementations or components
5. **Precise Timing**: Accurate start/end timestamps with detailed progression logs

## Success Criteria
- All methods complete with comprehensive timing logs
- Direct time comparison: 2.505 vs 2.505.2
- Statistical analysis of acceleration patterns
- Validation of severed branch methodology impact

## Research Questions
1. **Primary**: Do severed branches universally accelerate development?
2. **Secondary**: Do methodology rankings remain consistent?
3. **Tertiary**: What percentage acceleration does clean-slate provide?
4. **Exploratory**: Does component absence affect different methodologies differently?

## Expected Impact
This experiment will definitively answer whether the dramatic speed improvements in 1.507.3 were due to:
- **Clean-slate advantage** (all methods benefit from severed branches)
- **Methodology-specific patterns** (some methodologies inherently faster)
- **Task complexity factors** (QR generator simpler than JSON validator)
