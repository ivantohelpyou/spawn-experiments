SEVERED BRANCH TIMING - METHOD 1: IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION
======================================================

Experiment: 2.505.2-severed-branch-timing
Method: 1 - Immediate Implementation
Task: JSON Schema Validator CLI (identical to 2.505)

START TIME: 2025-09-25 18:32:15 UTC
END TIME: 2025-09-25 18:47:35 UTC
TOTAL DURATION: 15 minutes 20 seconds

Development Approach:
- Direct, practical problem solving
- Building a working solution quickly
- Implementation-driven decisions
- Adding features as needs became apparent during development

METHODOLOGY NOTES:
Used the Immediate Implementation approach with focus on:
1. Direct, practical problem solving
2. Building a working solution quickly
3. Implementation-driven decisions
4. Adding features as needs became apparent during development

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ All specified requirements met:
1. ✅ JSON data and schema file input support
2. ✅ Detailed error reporting with path information
3. ✅ Batch validation with progress indicators
4. ✅ Multiple output formats (text, JSON, CSV)
5. ✅ Progress indicators with ETA for batch operations
6. ✅ Dry-run mode for schema checking
7. ✅ JSON Schema Draft 7 support
8. ✅ Comprehensive format validation
9. ✅ Proper CLI argument parsing
10. ✅ Error handling with meaningful messages
11. ✅ stdin support
12. ✅ Wildcard file pattern support

DELIVERABLES:
- jsv.py (main CLI application)
- setup.py (package configuration)
- requirements.txt (dependencies)
- test_schema.json (sample schema)
- test_data_valid.json (valid test data)
- test_data_invalid.json (invalid test data)
- test_data_partial.json (partial test data)

WORKING EXAMPLES:
- jsv validate data.json schema.json ✅
- jsv batch validate *.json --schema=schema.json --output=csv ✅
- jsv check-schema schema.json --dry-run ✅
- jsv validate --data=stdin --schema=schema.json ✅
