SEVERED BRANCH TIMING - METHOD 4: ADAPTIVE TDD V4.1
=================================================

Experiment: 2.505.2-severed-branch-timing
Method: 4 - Adaptive TDD V4.1
Task: JSON Schema Validator CLI (identical to 2.505)

START TIME: 2025-09-25 15:11:17.048 UTC
END TIME: 2025-09-25 15:16:37.889 UTC
TOTAL DURATION: 5 minutes 20.841 seconds

Adaptive TDD V4.1 Development Process:
1. Started Simple: First test was just importing the module
2. Evolutionary Design: Each test drove the minimal implementation needed
3. Incremental Complexity:
   - Module exists → validate function exists → simple validation → error handling → CLI → file handling → format validation
4. Natural Architecture: The design emerged organically from the test requirements
5. Rapid Feedback: Each change was immediately tested
6. Emergent Refactoring: Enhanced error reporting and CLI features were added as needs arose

TEST EVOLUTION:
1. test_jsv_module_exists: Simplest test - can we import the module?
2. test_validate_function_exists: Can we call validate function?
3. test_validate_simple_json: Can we validate simple JSON?
4. test_validate_invalid_json: Should reject invalid JSON
5. test_cli_main_function_exists: CLI should have main function
6. test_validate_files_function: Should be able to validate files
7. test_validate_with_errors: Should return detailed errors
8. test_format_validation: Should validate email format

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Core Requirements:
1. Accepts JSON data and schema files as input
2. Validates data against schema with detailed error reporting
3. Supports batch validation of multiple files
4. Provides output in multiple formats (text, JSON, CSV)
5. Includes progress indicators for large batch operations
6. Offers dry-run mode to check schemas without validation

✅ Technical Requirements:
- JSON Schema Draft 7 support (via jsonschema library)
- Comprehensive format validation including email, date, uri
- CLI with proper argument parsing
- Error handling with meaningful messages
- Progress indicators for batch operations
- Multiple output formats (text, JSON, CSV)

ADAPTIVE TDD V4.1 CHARACTERISTICS:
- Started with simplest failing test
- Design emerged naturally from test requirements
- Incremental complexity building
- Rapid feedback loops
- Natural refactoring as patterns emerged
- Clean, focused final implementation
- 8 comprehensive tests all passing
- 100% functionality coverage including edge cases

DELIVERABLES:
- jsv.py: Main CLI implementation
- test_jsv.py: Comprehensive test suite
- setup.py: Package configuration
- requirements.txt: Dependencies
- test_schema.json: Sample schema file
- README.md: Usage documentation
