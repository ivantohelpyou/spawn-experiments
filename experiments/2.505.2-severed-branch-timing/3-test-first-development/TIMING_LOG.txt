SEVERED BRANCH TIMING - METHOD 3: TEST-FIRST DEVELOPMENT (TDD)
============================================================

Experiment: 2.505.2-severed-branch-timing
Method: 3 - Test-First Development (TDD)
Task: JSON Schema Validator CLI (identical to 2.505)

START TIME: 2025-09-25 15:36:13 UTC
END TIME: 2025-09-25 15:47:35 UTC
TOTAL DURATION: 11 minutes 22 seconds

TDD Development Process:
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles followed strictly
- Tests written before implementation for each feature
- Incremental development with immediate validation
- Comprehensive test coverage throughout development process

TEST COVERAGE ACHIEVED:
- test_cli.py: Basic CLI and validation tests (93 lines)
- test_batch.py: Batch validation and schema checking tests (182 lines)
- test_formats.py: Format validation and stdin input tests (165 lines)
- test_progress.py: Progress indicator tests (61 lines)
- test_edge_cases.py: Error handling and complex schema tests (208 lines)
- test_integration.py: Complete integration tests (172 lines)
- Total: 33 comprehensive tests, 100% pass rate

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
✅ JSON Schema Draft 7 support with comprehensive format validation
✅ CLI with proper argument parsing using argparse with subcommands
✅ Single file validation with detailed error reporting
✅ Batch validation of multiple files with progress indicators
✅ Multiple output formats (text, JSON, CSV)
✅ Stdin input support for data validation
✅ Schema validation with dry-run mode
✅ Progress indicators for large batch operations
✅ Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
✅ Robust test coverage (33 tests, 100% pass rate)

TDD METHODOLOGY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Test-first approach ensured high code quality
- Incremental development with immediate feedback
- Comprehensive test coverage from start
- Error handling thoroughly tested
- Integration tests verified complete system functionality

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Fast startup time with minimal imports
- Efficient JSON processing using built-in json module
- Memory efficient streaming of large file batches
- Progress indicators for user feedback on large operations
- Proper exit codes for shell integration
