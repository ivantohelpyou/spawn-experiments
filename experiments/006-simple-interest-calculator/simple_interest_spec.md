# Simple Interest Calculator

Build a simple interest calculator application in Python.

## Core Features

- Calculate simple interest using the formula: Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
- Input validation for positive numbers (principal, rate, time must be > 0)
- Basic output formatting showing the calculated interest amount
- Command-line interface for user interaction

## Requirements

- Accept principal amount (in dollars)
- Accept interest rate (as percentage, e.g., 5 for 5%)
- Accept time period (in years)
- Display calculated simple interest
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully
- Provide clear user prompts and formatted output

## Expected Behavior

```
Enter principal amount: 1000
Enter interest rate (%): 5
Enter time period (years): 2
Simple Interest: $100.00
```

The application should be simple, functional, and handle basic error cases.
