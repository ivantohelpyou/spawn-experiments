# Method 1: Direct Implementation Approach

**Approach**: Build the multilingual word counter directly without extensive planning or testing.

**Prompt Used**:
```
Build a multilingual word counter program using Python (with language detection libraries).

Make it fully functional with all the features you think it should have. Include a user interface and all necessary functionality.
```

**Research Interest**: How does this approach perform in terms of development speed, feature completeness, code quality, and maintainability?

**Success Criteria**:
- Time to working implementation
- Feature completeness
- Code quality metrics
- User interface usability
