# Unicode Password Manager Experiment

This experiment demonstrates TDD in the AI Era through four distinct development approaches applied to building a Unicode-aware password manager.

## Experiment Results

| Method | Time | Bugs | Coverage | Quality |
|--------|------|------|----------|---------|
| Method 1: Naive | 15 min | 15+ bugs | 0% | ❌ Broken |
| Method 2: Spec-First | 195 min | 5 bugs | 20% | ⚠️ Gaps |
| Method 3: TDD | 150 min | 1-2 bugs | 90% | ✅ Good |
| Method 4: Enhanced TDD | 240 min | 0 bugs | 98% | 🏆 Excellent |

## Key Finding

**16x time investment → 100% bug reduction**

Methodology choice dramatically impacts software quality when dealing with Unicode complexity.

## Directory Structure

- `method-1-naive/` - Direct "just build it" approach
- `method-2-spec-first/` - Specification-driven development
- `method-3-tdd/` - Traditional Test-Driven Development
- `method-4-enhanced-tdd/` - TDD with test validation
- `FINAL_COMPARISON.md` - Comprehensive results analysis
- `DEMO_SCRIPT.py` - Live presentation demo

## What We Built

A Unicode-aware password manager focusing on:
- ✅ International service names (`📧 Gmail`, `🏦 Bank of América`)
- ✅ Emoji-tolerant search ("gmail" finds "📧 Gmail Account")
- ✅ Diacritic-insensitive search ("cafe" finds "Café WiFi")
- ✅ Multi-script support (Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese)
- ✅ Fuzzy search with typo tolerance

## Core Insight

AI amplifies your methodology - good practices yield excellent results, poor practices yield broken software. Unicode complexity provides the perfect test case for demonstrating this principle.
