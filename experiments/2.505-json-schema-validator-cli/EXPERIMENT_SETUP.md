# Experiment 2.505: JSON Schema Validator CLI Tool (Tier 2)

**Tier**: 2 (CLI Tools with Component Discovery)

**Domain**: 5 (Input Validation)

**Sequence**: 05 (JSON Schema Validator CLI)

**Date**: September 22, 2025

**Technology**: Python CLI with available validation components

## üéØ Experiment Design

### **Component Discovery Research**

This Tier 2 experiment tests **natural component discovery and integration patterns** when building a CLI tool with pre-existing validation components available.

**Available Components** (in `utils/validation/`):
- `email_validator.py` - From 1.501 (Method 3 TDD winner)
- `url_validator.py` - From 1.502 (Method 3 TDD winner)
- `file_path_validator.py` - From 1.503 (Constrained injection winner)
- `date_validator.py` - From 1.504 (Method 4 V4.1 winner)

**Research Questions**:
1. Which methodologies naturally discover and reuse existing validators?
2. How do methods integrate format validation (email, date, uri) from existing components?
3. What drives the decision to reuse vs. rebuild functionality?
4. How does component availability affect architectural decisions?

## üß™ Baseline Specification

**Core CLI Requirements**:
```
Build a command-line JSON Schema Validator tool that:

1. Accepts JSON data and schema files as input
2. Validates data against schema with detailed error reporting
3. Supports batch validation of multiple files
4. Provides output in multiple formats (text, JSON, CSV)
5. Includes progress indicators for large batch operations
6. Offers dry-run mode to check schemas without validation

Usage Examples:
- jsv validate data.json schema.json
- jsv batch validate *.json --schema=schema.json --output=csv
- jsv check-schema schema.json --dry-run
- jsv validate --data=stdin --schema=schema.json

The tool should leverage JSON Schema Draft 7 features and provide
comprehensive format validation including email, date, and uri formats.
```

## üî¨ Tool Whitelisting Configuration

**Pre-approved Operations** (no user interaction required):

```yaml
whitelist:
  file_operations:
    - Read: "experiments/2.505-*/**"
    - Write: "experiments/2.505-*/**"
    - Edit: "experiments/2.505-*/**"
    - Read: "utils/validation/**"  # Component discovery allowed

  bash_operations:
    - pattern: "mkdir -p experiments/2.505-*"
    - pattern: "python experiments/2.505-*/**/*.py"
    - pattern: "python -m pytest experiments/2.505-*"
    - pattern: "git add experiments/2.505-*"
    - pattern: "git commit -m *"
    - pattern: "git checkout -b exp-2505-*"
    - pattern: "find utils/validation -name *.py"  # Discovery allowed
    - pattern: "grep -r 'validate_' utils/"  # Discovery allowed

  discovery_operations:
    - Glob: "utils/validation/*.py"
    - Grep: "utils/validation/**"
```

## üìä Success Metrics

### **Component Discovery Metrics**
- Discovery rate: % of methods that find utils/validation
- Integration depth: How many validators are reused
- Discovery time: Time spent exploring vs. building
- Architecture impact: How discovery affects design

### **Traditional Metrics**
- Development time (with precise git timestamps)
- Lines of code
- Test coverage
- Feature completeness

---

## üöÄ Experiment Execution Protocol

### **Method Prompts** (Component discovery not mentioned)

Each method receives the baseline specification WITHOUT any mention of available components. This tests natural discovery patterns.

### **Prediction Protocol**

Before execution, predict:
1. Which methods will discover utils/validation?
2. How will discovery affect development time?
3. Will methods prefer reuse or rebuild?
4. How will architectures differ with/without discovery?

### **Post-Experiment Analysis**

Compare:
- Discovery patterns across methodologies
- Integration strategies (wrapper, inheritance, composition)
- Time saved/spent on component evaluation
- Quality differences between reused vs. rebuilt

---

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

### **Discovery Predictions**
- **Method 1 (Immediate)**: Unlikely to discover, will rebuild
- **Method 2 (Specification)**: May discover during design phase
- **Method 3 (TDD)**: Discovery during test writing
- **Method 4 (V4.1 Adaptive)**: Strategic discovery during planning

### **Integration Predictions**
- Methods that discover will save 30-50% development time
- Reused components will have better edge case handling
- Architecture will shift toward composition patterns

## üìù Notes

This experiment represents the **first true component discovery research** in the framework. The availability of high-quality validation components creates an authentic development scenario where reuse vs. rebuild decisions have real consequences.

The tier separation (1‚Üí2) allows us to study how development practices change when moving from isolated functions to integrated tools with available libraries.
