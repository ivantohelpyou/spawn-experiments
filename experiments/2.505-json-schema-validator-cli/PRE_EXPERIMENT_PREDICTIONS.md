# Pre-Experiment Predictions: JSON Schema Validator CLI (Tier 2)

**Experiment**: 2.505 - JSON Schema Validator CLI Tool
**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Technology Stack**: Python CLI with jsonschema library
**Available Components**: utils/validation/ (email, url, file_path, date validators)

---

## üîÆ Component Discovery Predictions

### **Method 1 (Immediate Implementation)**
**Discovery Prediction**: UNLIKELY (10% chance)
- Will likely rebuild all validators inline
- May hardcode format validation logic
- Focus on speed over exploration

**If Discovery Occurs**:
- Accidental discovery through file browsing
- Minimal integration, likely copy-paste

### **Method 2 (Specification-Driven)**
**Discovery Prediction**: MODERATE (40% chance)
- May explore project structure during specification phase
- Could document available components in design
- Systematic approach might include component audit

**If Discovery Occurs**:
- Will create abstraction layer around validators
- Likely over-engineer integration patterns

### **Method 3 (Pure TDD)**
**Discovery Prediction**: MODERATE-HIGH (50% chance)
- Test writing might trigger search for existing validators
- "Don't repeat yourself" principle could drive discovery
- Natural search for email validation when writing email tests

**If Discovery Occurs**:
- Clean integration through imports
- Test-driven wrapper functions

### **Method 4 (V4.1 Adaptive TDD)**
**Discovery Prediction**: HIGH (70% chance)
- Planning phase likely includes codebase exploration
- Strategic approach favors reuse over rebuild
- Adaptive methodology should recognize efficiency opportunity

**If Discovery Occurs**:
- Strategic integration of format validators
- Optimal balance of reuse and custom code

## üìä Development Time Predictions

| Method | **Without Discovery** | **With Discovery** | Time Saved |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Method 1** | 8-10 minutes | 6-8 minutes | 20-25% |
| **Method 2** | 18-22 minutes | 15-18 minutes | 15-20% |
| **Method 3** | 12-15 minutes | 8-10 minutes | 30-35% |
| **Method 4** | 10-12 minutes | 7-9 minutes | 25-30% |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Predictions

### **Without Component Discovery**
- Each method implements format validation from scratch
- 400-600 lines of code expected
- Duplicate email/date/url validation logic
- Potential inconsistencies in validation rules

### **With Component Discovery**
- Composition-based architecture
- 250-400 lines of code expected
- Consistent validation through reused components
- Focus shifts to CLI features rather than validation logic

---

## üéØ Specific Discovery Patterns

### **Search Patterns Expected**
1. **Grep for "validate"** - Most likely discovery method
2. **Browse utils/ directory** - Systematic exploration
3. **Search for "email"** when implementing email format
4. **Import attempt** - Try `from utils import` speculatively

### **Integration Patterns Predicted**
- **Direct Import**: `from utils.validation import validate_email`
- **Wrapper Pattern**: Create facade around validators
- **Copy-Paste**: Copy code rather than import (Method 1)
- **Inheritance**: Extend validator classes (Method 2)

## üî¨ Research Hypotheses

### **H1: Discovery Correlation**
Methods with more planning (2, 4) will have higher discovery rates than immediate approaches (1, 3).

### **H2: Time Impact**
Component discovery will reduce development time by 25-35% across all methods.

### **H3: Quality Improvement**
Methods that discover components will have better format validation coverage and fewer edge case bugs.

### **H4: Architecture Influence**
Discovery will shift architecture from monolithic to composition-based design.

## üìà Success Metrics

### **Discovery Metrics**
- Time of first utils/ access (if any)
- Number of validators reused (0-4)
- Integration approach (import/copy/ignore)
- Time spent exploring vs. building

### **Quality Metrics**
- Format validation completeness
- Edge case handling
- Code duplication
- Test coverage

### **Efficiency Metrics**
- Total development time
- Lines of code
- Features implemented
- Bug count

## üé™ Wild Card Predictions

### **Surprising Outcomes**
1. **Method 1 discovers through error** - Import error leads to utils/ discovery
2. **Method 3 discovers everything** - TDD discipline drives systematic reuse
3. **No methods discover** - All rebuild from scratch despite availability
4. **Partial discovery** - Find some but not all validators

### **Architecture Surprises**
- Methods might discover but choose not to use (quality concerns)
- Creative integration patterns we haven't predicted
- Discovery changes entire approach to problem

## üèÅ Component Discovery Ranking Prediction

1. **Method 4 (V4.1 Adaptive)** - 70% discovery chance, best integration
2. **Method 3 (Pure TDD)** - 50% discovery chance, clean integration
3. **Method 2 (Specification)** - 40% discovery chance, over-engineered integration
4. **Method 1 (Immediate)** - 10% discovery chance, minimal integration

## üîç What We're Watching For

1. **First utils/ access timestamp** - When does discovery occur?
2. **Discovery trigger** - What causes methods to look for components?
3. **Integration decision** - Why reuse vs. rebuild?
4. **Architecture impact** - How does discovery change design?
5. **Time allocation** - Exploration vs. implementation time

This experiment will reveal how different methodologies approach component discovery in realistic development scenarios, providing crucial insights for Tier 2+ framework evolution.
