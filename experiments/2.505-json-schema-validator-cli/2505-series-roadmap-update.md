# Roadmap Update: Component Discovery Research (2.505 Series)

**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Status**: Major framework breakthrough achieved
**Impact**: Tier 2+ research now enabled

## üö® BREAKTHROUGH: Component Discovery Problem Solved

### **Experiments 2.505 & 2.505.1 Results**

#### **2.505 Baseline: Universal Discovery Failure**
- **All 4 methodologies**: 0% component discovery rate
- **Available components**: Proven utils/validation validators
- **Environment**: Components present but no guidance provided
- **Conclusion**: AI systems require explicit awareness for component discovery

#### **2.505.1 Guided Discovery: Universal Success**
- **Simple guidance added**: "utils/ contains components you may use"
- **All 4 methodologies**: 100% component discovery rate
- **Integration patterns**: 4 distinct approaches emerged naturally
- **Conclusion**: Minimal guidance transforms discovery behavior completely

#### **2.505.1 Method 1E: External Library Analysis**
- **External libraries encouraged**: click, rich, jsonschema, email-validator, tabulate
- **Result**: 70% time increase (4m 41.5s vs 2m 45.1s) but 20% fewer lines and richer features
- **Trade-off**: Setup/integration overhead vs feature richness and professional polish

## üéØ Strategic Framework Implications

### **For Tier 2+ Experiments**
- **Component guidance is now STANDARD** in all multi-tier experiments
- **Discovery problem solved**: Focus shifts to integration pattern optimization
- **External library research enabled**: Can study dependency management patterns

### **For Methodology Research**
- **Method 4 over-engineering risk**: Requires constraints for external libraries
- **Integration pattern stability**: Methodologies maintain characteristics with components
- **Testing overhead quantified**: Quality-driven approaches invest more time in validation

### **For Experimental Design**
- **Research-question driven component access**: Internal vs external should serve specific goals
- **Tool whitelisting enhanced**: Environment isolation for external library experiments
- **Timing accuracy critical**: Task tool measurements vs agent self-reporting

## üîß Framework Enhancements Implemented

### **META_PROMPT_GENERATOR_V4 Updates**
- **Directory isolation enforcement**: Keep experiments in their lanes
- **External library protocols**: Environment setup and dependency tracking
- **Integration verification**: Proper file placement requirements

### **Component Guidance Protocol**
```yaml
standard_component_hint:
  text: "The project contains a utils/ directory with pre-built components from previous experiments that you may choose to use or ignore as you see fit."
  discovery_rate: 100%
  methodology_preservation: true
```

### **External Library Prompting Strategies**
- **Level 1**: Implicit permission (baseline adoption)
- **Level 2**: Explicit encouragement (maximum leverage)
- **Level 3**: Constrained selection (controlled research)
- **Level 4**: Hybrid strategy (balanced approach)

### **Method 4 Over-Engineering Prevention**
```yaml
method_4_external_constraint:
  text: "Focus on using libraries directly without building extensive wrapper frameworks. Solve the problem, don't architect perfect abstractions around libraries."
  purpose: Prevent time-consuming over-engineering of external library integration
```
