**Architectural Approach**: Layered validation with custom error handling system
**Potential Issues**: Over-engineering for simple validation task, unnecessary complexity

### **Method 3 (Pure TDD - Mechanical Rabbit)**
**Predicted Development Time**: 6-8 minutes
**Predicted Code Volume**: 180-220 lines
**Predicted Approach**:
- Test-driven development starting with edge cases
- Incremental validation feature building
- Focus on test coverage and correctness
- Clean, minimal implementation

**Architectural Approach**: Test-constrained implementation with good separation of concerns
**Potential Issues**: May be slower due to comprehensive test writing

### **Method 4 (V4.1 Adaptive TDD)**
**Predicted Development Time**: 4-6 minutes
**Predicted Code Volume**: 120-180 lines
**Predicted Approach**:
- Strategic test validation only for complex schema features
- Efficient implementation with targeted testing
- Balance of speed and quality
- Adaptive complexity matching

**Architectural Approach**: Efficient core with strategic validation for complex areas
**Potential Issues**: None expected - should achieve optimal balance

## Overall Methodology Ranking Prediction

1. **Method 4 (V4.1 Adaptive TDD)**: Expected winner - optimal speed/quality balance
2. **Method 3 (Pure TDD)**: Solid baseline performance, reliable quality
3. **Method 1 (Immediate)**: Fast but potentially incomplete
4. **Method 2 (Specification-Driven)**: Over-engineered for validation task

## Specific Areas Where Methods Might Excel/Struggle

### **JSON Schema Complexity**
- **Method 1**: May handle simple schemas well, struggle with edge cases
- **Method 2**: Likely to over-engineer validation logic unnecessarily
- **Method 3**: Will methodically cover all schema features through tests
- **Method 4**: Will strategically focus testing on complex schema features

### **Error Handling**
- **Method 1**: Basic error passing from jsonschema library
- **Method 2**: Overly elaborate error categorization system
- **Method 3**: Solid error handling driven by test requirements
- **Method 4**: Efficient error handling for user needs

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Method 1**: Direct library usage, minimal overhead
- **Method 2**: Potentially slower due to unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Method 3**: Efficient implementation constrained by tests
- **Method 4**: Optimized performance through strategic design

## Potential Surprises or Challenges

1. **Library Dependency Handling**: How each method deals with jsonschema import
2. **Schema Complexity**: How methods handle nested object validation
3. **Format Validation**: Different approaches to email/date/uri format checking
4. **Error Message Quality**: User-friendly vs technical error reporting

---

## Bias Detection Focus Areas

Based on patterns from experiments 1.501-1.504, watching for:

1. **Method 1 Underestimation**: AI may assume gaps in functionality that don't exist
2. **Method 2 Complexity Explosion**: Previous experiments show 6.4X to 32.3X over-engineering
3. **Method 3 Consistency**: Should maintain ~200 line baseline for input validation
4. **Method 4 Optimization**: V4.1 framework should achieve superior efficiency

## Research Questions

1. Will V4.1 Adaptive TDD maintain its performance advantage in structured data validation?
2. How will Method 2 handle the jsonschema library - embrace or reinvent?
3. Will Method 3 TDD naturally constrain to reasonable complexity for schema validation?
4. What new AI biases will be revealed through prediction vs actual analysis?

**Framework Expectation**: This experiment should confirm V4.1 Adaptive TDD as the innovation leader while Method 3 Pure TDD provides the constraint-driven baseline for competitive comparison.
