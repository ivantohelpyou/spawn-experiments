## Key Insights & Recommendations

### Insight 1: Specification-Driven Produces Production-Ready Code
Method 2 achieved the highest score (88/100) by delivering comprehensive architecture, exceptional error handling, and complete documentation. The upfront design time was minimal (~8 min total) but resulted in the most maintainable solution.

### Insight 2: Adaptive TDD Balances Speed and Quality
Method 4 (83/100) demonstrated that strategic validation adds only ~20% time overhead while providing high confidence in test quality. Validating complex algorithms but skipping simple code proved efficient.

### Insight 3: Pure TDD is Fastest But Needs Completion Discipline
Method 3 completed in just 5 minutes, proving TDD's efficiency constraint. However, the experiment revealed the need for completion discipline - tests were written but implementation remained partial.

### Insight 4: Immediate Implementation is Pragmatic and Effective
Method 1 (78/100) delivered a fully functional solution in 10 minutes with good test coverage. While less architected than Method 2, it proves effective for rapid prototyping with quality.

### Insight 5: All Methods Use Similar Core Algorithms
Despite different approaches, all methods converged on:
- Vowel-group syllable counting
- Silent 'e' handling
- Subprocess-based Ollama integration
- LLM prompting strategies

This suggests the methodology affects structure more than algorithmic choices.
