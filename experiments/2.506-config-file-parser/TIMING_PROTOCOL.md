# Experiment 2.506: Timing Protocol

## Three-Stage Timing Capture

### Stage 1: Initial → Library List
**Start**: When prompt is given

**End**: When they list libraries and pause

**Captures**: Time to analyze requirements and select libraries

### Stage 2: "Why?" → Reasoning
**Start**: When "Why?" is asked

**End**: When explanation is complete

**Captures**: Reasoning generation time (unprepared response)

### Stage 3: "Ok go" → Implementation
**Start**: When "Ok go" is given

**End**: When implementation is complete

**Captures**: Actual development time

## Recording Format

```
Method 1 - Immediate Implementation
Stage 1: [START: 10:00:00] → [LIST: 10:01:30] = 1m 30s
Stage 2: [WHY: 10:01:35] → [EXPLAIN: 10:01:45] = 10s
Stage 3: [GO: 10:01:50] → [COMPLETE: 10:08:00] = 6m 10s
Total: 7m 50s (Stage 1: 1m 30s | Stage 2: 10s | Stage 3: 6m 10s)

Method 2 - Specification-Driven
Stage 1: [START: 10:00:00] → [LIST: 10:03:00] = 3m
Stage 2: [WHY: 10:03:05] → [EXPLAIN: 10:03:45] = 40s
Stage 3: [GO: 10:03:50] → [COMPLETE: 10:16:00] = 12m 10s
Total: 15m 50s (Stage 1: 3m | Stage 2: 40s | Stage 3: 12m 10s)
```

## Metrics to Extract

### Stage 1 Metrics
- Time to library decision
- Number of libraries listed
- Unified vs individual library approach

### Stage 2 Metrics
- Response time (immediate vs considered)
- Word count of explanation
- Criteria mentioned (performance, popularity, testing, etc.)

### Stage 3 Metrics
- Implementation speed
- Architecture chosen
- Test coverage (if applicable)

## Comparison Points

**Speed to Decision** (Stage 1):
- Which methodology decides fastest?
- Does analysis paralysis affect certain methods?

**Reasoning Depth** (Stage 2):
- Correlation between reasoning time and depth
- Methodology-specific justification patterns

**Implementation Efficiency** (Stage 3):
- Does longer planning (Stage 1) reduce Stage 3 time?
- Total time vs quality trade-offs

## Expected Patterns

**Method 1**: Fast Stage 1 (1-2m), minimal Stage 2 (10s), moderate Stage 3 (6-8m)
**Method 2**: Slow Stage 1 (3-4m), detailed Stage 2 (30-60s), longer Stage 3 (10-15m)
**Method 3**: Moderate Stage 1 (2-3m), focused Stage 2 (20s), longer Stage 3 (8-12m)
**Method 4**: Strategic Stage 1 (2-3m), balanced Stage 2 (20-30s), efficient Stage 3 (7-10m)
