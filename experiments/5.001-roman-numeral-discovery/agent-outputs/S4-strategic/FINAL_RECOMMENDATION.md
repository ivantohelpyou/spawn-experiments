# Final Evidence-Based Recommendation: Roman Numeral Conversion Solution

**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Analysis Duration**: 15 minutes
**Context**: Educational software for middle school students

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of 15+ solutions across PyPI libraries, GitHub implementations, and custom approaches, **I recommend a custom educational implementation with step-by-step explanation features** as the optimal solution for your middle school Roman numeral teaching software.

## Key Finding: Educational Context Changes Everything

While the existing analysis correctly identifies Custom TDD Implementation as optimal for general use cases, **the educational context fundamentally shifts the evaluation criteria**. The primary goal is not just conversion, but helping students understand *how* and *why* the conversion works.

## Optimal Solution: Custom Educational Implementation

### Recommended Approach
```python
class EducationalRomanConverter:
    """Roman numeral converter optimized for educational use."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.conversion_steps = []
        self.roman_mapping = [
            (1000, "M", "One thousand"),
            (900, "CM", "Nine hundred (1000 - 100)"),
            (500, "D", "Five hundred"),
            (400, "CD", "Four hundred (500 - 100)"),
            (100, "C", "One hundred"),
            (90, "XC", "Ninety (100 - 10)"),
            (50, "L", "Fifty"),
            (40, "XL", "Forty (50 - 10)"),
            (10, "X", "Ten"),
            (9, "IX", "Nine (10 - 1)"),
            (5, "V", "Five"),
            (4, "IV", "Four (5 - 1)"),
            (1, "I", "One")
        ]

    def convert_with_explanation(self, number):
        """Convert with detailed step-by-step explanation for students."""
        # Implementation returns both result and learning steps

    def get_conversion_steps(self):
        """Return educational explanation of conversion process."""
        # Returns student-friendly step-by-step breakdown
```

## Why This Beats All Other Options

### vs. PyPI Libraries (roman-numerals, RomanPy, etc.)
- **Libraries are "black boxes"** - students can't see the conversion logic
- **No step-by-step explanation** capability built-in
- **External dependencies** violate your constraint
- **Educational value**: ⭐⭐ vs. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ for custom

### vs. Existing Custom Implementations
- **Experiment 1.103 implementations lack educational features**
- **Focus on code quality, not teaching value**
- **No explanation or step-tracking capabilities**
- **Educational value**: ⭐⭐⭐ vs. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ for educational version

## Educational-Specific Features

### 1. Step-by-Step Explanation
```
Converting 1944:
Step 1: 1944 ÷ 1000 = 1 remainder 944 → Add "M" (one thousand)
Step 2: 944 ÷ 900 = 1 remainder 44 → Add "CM" (nine hundred)
Step 3: 44 ÷ 40 = 1 remainder 4 → Add "XL" (forty)
Step 4: 4 ÷ 4 = 1 remainder 0 → Add "IV" (four)
Result: MCMXLIV
```

### 2. Rule Teaching
- Explains subtractive notation (IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM)
- Shows why certain combinations are valid/invalid
- Connects to historical context

### 3. Interactive Learning Support
- Progressive complexity (start with simple numbers)
- Common mistake identification and correction
- Real-world examples (clock faces, monuments)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Algorithm (2-3 hours)
- Build mapping-based conversion with step tracking
- Add input validation for range 1-3999
- Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 2: Educational Features (3-4 hours)
- Implement step-by-step explanation generator
- Add rule-based teaching explanations
- Create student-friendly error messages

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 hours)
- Package for easy integration
- Add documentation for educators
- Create usage examples

**Total Investment**: 6-9 hours for production-ready educational solution

## Evidence Supporting This Choice

### From Educational Research
- "Learning Roman numerals is a great way to help children increase their number sense"
- Step-by-step conversion teaching identified as best practice
- Visual/transparent algorithms improve understanding

### From Technical Analysis
- Mapping algorithm is most educationally transparent
- Custom implementation allows perfect feature fit
- Zero dependencies meets your constraint

### From Pedagogical Requirements
- Middle school students need *understanding*, not just conversion
- Software should help explain *why* rules work
- Step-by-step process builds mathematical thinking

## Why Not Other "Good" Options?

### zopefoundation/roman (High-rated in analysis)
❌ **Educational value too low** - students learn nothing about the process
❌ **External dependency** - violates constraint
❌ **No explanation features** - can't teach conversion steps

### Custom TDD Implementation (Analysis winner)
❌ **Missing educational features** - optimized for code quality, not teaching
❌ **No step-by-step capability** - students see result but not process
❌ **No rule explanation** - doesn't help understand Roman numeral logic

### RomanPy (Feature-rich)
❌ **Over-engineered for education** - too many features create complexity
❌ **External dependency** - violates constraint
❌ **Focus on advanced features** - Unicode/arithmetic not needed for learning

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- ✅ 100% accuracy for range 1-3999
- ✅ < 10ms conversion time
- ✅ Zero external dependencies
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage

### Educational
- ✅ Students can explain conversion steps after using tool
- ✅ Improves understanding of number systems
- ✅ Positive feedback from educators
- ✅ Increased engagement with Roman numerals

## Conclusion

**The optimal solution is a purpose-built educational implementation** that prioritizes learning value over raw functionality. While general-purpose solutions excel at conversion, only a custom educational implementation can achieve your primary goal: helping middle school students understand how Roman numeral conversion actually works.

**Investment**: 6-9 hours of development
**Return**: Perfect fit for educational needs with zero dependencies
**Key Success Factor**: Students learn the process, not just the result

*This recommendation prioritizes educational value above all other criteria, as appropriate for teaching software where understanding the process is more important than optimizing the conversion itself.*
