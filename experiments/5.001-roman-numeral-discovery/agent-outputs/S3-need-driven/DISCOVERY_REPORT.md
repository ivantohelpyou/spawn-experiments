## üìã Precise Requirements Specification

Based on the educational context, the following requirements were defined:

### **Primary Educational Requirements**
1. **Core Functionality**: Bidirectional conversion (integers ‚Üî roman numerals)
2. **Educational Value**: Help middle school students understand conversion process
3. **Step-by-step Explanation**: Show how conversions work, not just results
4. **Understandability**: Code should be explainable to students/teachers
5. **Simplicity**: No complex dependencies that obscure learning process

### **Technical Constraints**
- Educational value prioritized over performance optimization
- Clear, readable implementation
- Minimal external dependencies
- Should demonstrate the algorithm, not hide it
- Target range: 1-3999 (standard Roman numeral range)

### **Success Criteria**
- Students can follow the conversion logic
- Teachers can explain how it works
- Shows the thinking process behind roman numeral rules
- Handles standard educational examples effectively

## üéØ Primary Recommendation

### **SELECTED SOLUTION: Custom Educational Implementation**

**File**: `/home/ivan/projects/spawn-experiments/experiments/5.001-roman-numeral-discovery/educational_roman_converter.py`

**Justification**:
1. **Perfect Requirement Match**: Meets all educational criteria
2. **Transparent Process**: Every conversion step is explained
3. **Interactive Learning**: Students can follow the algorithm
4. **Teaching Tool**: Designed specifically for educational use
5. **Age-Appropriate**: Language suitable for middle school students

**Example Output for Teaching**:
```
=== Converting 1984 to Roman Numerals ===
Step: 1984 √∑ 1000 = 1 remainder 984
      Add 'M' to result
      Result so far: 'M'
      Remaining to convert: 984

Step: 984 √∑ 900 = 1 remainder 84
      Add 'CM' to result
      Result so far: 'MCM'
      Remaining to convert: 84
...
Final result: 1984 = MCMLXXXIV
```
