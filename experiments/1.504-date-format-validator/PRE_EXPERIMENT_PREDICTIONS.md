# PRE-EXPERIMENT PREDICTIONS
**Experiment**: 1.504 Date Format Validator

**Date**: September 21, 2025

**Baseline**: Configurable date validation (MM/DD vs DD/MM, parameterized year range, boolean return)

## Methodology Predictions

### Method 1 (Immediate Implementation)
**Expected Outcome**: Quick regex-based solution with basic validation
**Predicted Lines**: ~120-180 lines
**Predicted Time**: 4-6 minutes
**Predicted Issues**: May miss leap year edge cases initially, basic error handling
**Architecture**: Single function or simple class with regex patterns and basic date logic

**Strengths**: Fast implementation, straightforward approach

**Weaknesses**: Likely to have validation gaps, minimal configurability

### Method 2 (Human-Reviewed Specification)
**Expected Outcome**: Well-structured validator with comprehensive parameter handling
**Predicted Lines**: ~200-300 lines
**Predicted Time**: 8-12 minutes
**Predicted Issues**: May over-specify edge case handling, could add unnecessary complexity
**Architecture**: Class-based design with clear separation of concerns, configuration management

**Strengths**: Thorough documentation, comprehensive parameter handling

**Weaknesses**: Potential scope creep during specification phase

### Method 3 (Pure TDD)
**Expected Outcome**: Incremental, test-driven development with solid validation logic
**Predicted Lines**: ~150-220 lines
**Predicted Time**: 7-10 minutes
**Predicted Issues**: May discover edge cases through test failures, iterative refinement needed
**Architecture**: Minimal class focused on test requirements, clean API design

**Strengths**: Comprehensive test coverage, reliable validation logic

**Weaknesses**: May take longer due to test-first discipline

### Method 4 (Specification-Guided TDD)
**Expected Outcome**: Planned approach with TDD implementation, balanced structure
**Predicted Lines**: ~180-250 lines
**Predicted Time**: 8-11 minutes
**Predicted Issues**: Balance between upfront planning and test discipline
**Architecture**: Structured class with planned test scenarios and clear parameter handling

**Strengths**: Good planning + test coverage combination

**Weaknesses**: Potential overhead from dual planning approaches

## Overall Predictions

### Winner Prediction
**Method 3 (Pure TDD)** will likely produce the most reliable solution
- **Rationale**: Date validation has clear test cases (valid/invalid dates, leap years, edge cases)
- TDD naturally discovers the edge cases that matter most
- Constrains scope to essential functionality without over-engineering

### Methodology Rankings (Predicted)
1. **Method 3 (TDD)** - Most reliable, well-tested
2. **Method 4 (Guided TDD)** - Good balance of planning and testing
3. **Method 2 (Specification)** - Comprehensive but potentially over-engineered
4. **Method 1 (Immediate)** - Fast but likely has validation gaps

### Expected Surprises
- **Method 1** might handle basic cases well but miss subtle leap year rules
- **Method 2** could over-engineer the configuration system beyond requirements
- **Method 3** will likely discover the most edge cases through test failures
- **Method 4** might find that upfront planning reduces TDD iterations

### Common Challenges
- **Leap year calculation**: 1900 is not a leap year (divisible by 100 but not 400)
- **Date range validation**: Ensuring year bounds are properly enforced
- **Format ambiguity**: Handling dates like "01/12/2024" (Jan 12 vs Dec 1)
- **Edge case coverage**: Empty strings, malformed input, invalid date combinations

### Expected Patterns
- All methods should handle basic MM/DD/YYYY and DD/MM/YYYY formats correctly
- Configuration parameters (year range, format type) will vary in implementation elegance
- Test coverage will be highest in Methods 3 and 4
- Code complexity will likely follow: Method 1 < Method 3 < Method 4 < Method 2

## Specific Technical Predictions

### Leap Year Handling
- **Method 1**: Basic modulo 4 check (will miss 1900 edge case)
- **Method 2**: Comprehensive leap year specification with all rules
- **Method 3**: Will discover leap year edge cases through failing tests
- **Method 4**: Will plan for leap year complexity upfront

### Parameter Implementation
- **Method 1**: Hard-coded defaults, minimal configurability
- **Method 2**: Full parameter validation and extensive configuration options
- **Method 3**: Parameters driven by test requirements
- **Method 4**: Planned parameter structure with test validation

### Error Handling
- **Method 1**: Basic try/catch, minimal error messages
- **Method 2**: Comprehensive error categorization and messaging
- **Method 3**: Error handling driven by test edge cases
- **Method 4**: Planned error scenarios with test coverage

## Rationale
Date validation is a well-defined problem domain with clear success/failure criteria, making it ideal for TDD approaches. The configurability requirements (year range, format type) add enough complexity to differentiate methodology approaches while remaining focused. Historical knowledge suggests TDD excels in domains with clear test cases like input validation, while specification-driven approaches risk over-engineering unless properly constrained by human review.
