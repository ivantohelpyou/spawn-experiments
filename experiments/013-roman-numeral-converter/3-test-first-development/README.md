# Roman Numeral Converter - Test-Driven Development

## Overview
This implementation follows strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

## Development Timeline
- **Start Time**: 5:00:23 PM PDT
- **End Time**: 5:03:18 PM PDT
- **Total Duration**: ~3 minutes

## TDD Process Followed

### 1. RED Phase - Write Failing Tests
- Started with simple test for converting 1 to "I"
- Progressively added more complex test cases
- Each new test caused failures before implementation

### 2. GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
- Implemented just enough code to make tests pass
- Started with hardcoded values, evolved to algorithmic solution
- Never implemented more functionality than tests required

### 3. REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality
- Eliminated code duplication
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Improved class structure with shared data
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Features Implemented
- Integer to Roman numeral conversion (1-3999)
- Roman numeral to integer conversion
- Full support for subtractive notation (IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM)
- Case-insensitive Roman numeral input
- Input validation and error handling
- Roundtrip conversion verification

## Test Coverage
- 38 comprehensive test cases
- Edge case testing (boundary values)
- Error handling validation
- Roundtrip conversion verification
- Both directions of conversion thoroughly tested

## Code Quality
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Robust error handling
- DRY principle applied (shared mapping data)

This implementation demonstrates the power of TDD in creating robust, well-tested code with minimal development time.
