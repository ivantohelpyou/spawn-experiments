**Total Duration**: Approximately 6 minutes 13 seconds

## Methodology Notes

**Approach**: Direct, implementation-driven development
- Started with the core validation function and built outward
- Made practical decisions about character validation using simple character sets
- Used straightforward string operations and basic checks
- No external dependencies or complex regex patterns
- Focused on getting a working solution quickly

**Key Implementation Decisions**:
1. Split validation into logical helper functions for clarity
2. Used explicit character set validation instead of regex
3. Implemented length checks first as they're fastest to fail
4. Handled edge cases as they became apparent during testing
5. Created comprehensive test coverage to validate all requirements

**Files Created**:
- `email_validator.py` - Main implementation (92 lines)
- `test_email_validator.py` - Test suite (97 lines)
- `demo.py` - Demonstration script (54 lines)
- `timing_log.md` - This timing documentation

**Result**: Fully functional email validator meeting all specification requirements with comprehensive test coverage.
