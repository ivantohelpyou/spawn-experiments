# Experiment 1.501.1: Email Validator - Severed Branch Timing

## Objective
**Test the hypothesis that severed branch isolation accelerates development across ALL methodologies** using the simplest possible controlled experiment.

## Single Variable Experimental Design
- **Control Group**: Original 1.501 (Email Validator) with normal development context
- **Variable Group**: 1.501.1 with severed branch isolation (clean room protocol)
- **Constants**: Identical email validation task, same baseline specification, same 4 methodologies

## Hypothesis
**Severed branch isolation reduces development time across ALL methods** by eliminating:
- Context analysis overhead
- Existing codebase scanning
- Architectural decision paralysis
- Component discovery complexity

## Baseline Data (Original 1.501 Results)
- **Method 1**: Immediate Implementation - 1,405 total lines (530 impl + 474 tests + 401 demo)
- **Method 2**: Specification-driven Development - 872 total lines (366 impl + 325 tests + 181 demo)
- **Method 3**: Test-First Development (TDD) - 393 total lines (focused solution)
- **Method 4**: Adaptive TDD V4.1 - [Need to extract timing data from report]

**Note**: Original 1.501 didn't measure development time precisely - focused on code complexity analysis

## Methodology (Clean Single-Variable Design)
1. **Severed Branch Isolation**: Each method runs on completely isolated orphan branch
2. **Parallel Execution**: All 4 methods run simultaneously for fair comparison
3. **Identical Specification**: Same email validation requirements as original 1.501
4. **Clean Room Protocol**: Zero access to existing implementations or components
5. **Precise Timing**: Accurate start/end timestamps with detailed progression logs

## Success Criteria
- All methods complete with comprehensive timing logs
- Direct comparison possible: 1.501 complexity vs 1.501.1 timing + complexity
- Statistical analysis of acceleration patterns (if any)
- Validation that implementations actually work (with demo script)

## Expected Outcomes
If hypothesis is correct:
1. **Uniform acceleration**: All 4 methods faster in 1.501.1
2. **Preserved ratios**: Methodology ranking remains similar
3. **Quantifiable benefit**: Measurable time reduction percentage
4. **Complexity reduction**: Simpler implementations due to clean slate focus

If hypothesis is incorrect:
1. **No consistent timing improvement** across methods
2. **Some methods may be slower** (due to lack of context/guidance)
3. **Mixed results** indicating context-dependent benefits

## Research Questions
1. **Primary**: Do severed branches universally accelerate development?
2. **Secondary**: Do methodology rankings remain consistent across contexts?
3. **Tertiary**: What percentage acceleration does clean-slate provide?
4. **Qualitative**: Do implementations become simpler/more focused under isolation?

## Why This Experiment is Critical
- **Validates 2.505.2 findings** with simpler, cleaner task
- **Single variable control** eliminates confounding factors
- **Direct baseline comparison** with well-documented original results
- **Simple task domain** (email validation vs complex JSON CLI tools)

**Bottom Line**: This experiment will definitively answer whether the dramatic speed improvements we observed were due to clean-slate conditions or task-specific factors.
