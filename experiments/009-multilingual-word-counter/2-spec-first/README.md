# Method 2: Specification-First Implementation

**Approach**: Write comprehensive specifications first, then implement according to those specs.

**Prompt Used**:
```
First, write comprehensive specifications for a multilingual word counter program, then build the complete application.

Phase 1 - Specifications:
- List all features and requirements
- Define user stories and use cases
- Outline the technical architecture
- Specify data models and relationships
- Document business rules and constraints

Phase 2 - Implementation:
- Build the application according to the specifications
- Include all specified features
- Use Python (with language detection libraries) as the technology stack
- Ensure the final product matches the specifications

Provide both the specifications document and the complete implementation.
```

**Research Interest**: How does upfront specification affect development time, implementation accuracy, and final code quality?

**Success Criteria**:
- Quality of specifications
- Implementation adherence to specs
- Code organization and structure
- Feature coverage
