# Method 4: Test-Driven Implementation with Validation

**Approach**: Enhanced TDD with comprehensive test validation before implementation.

**Prompt Used**:
```
Create a multilingual word counter program using Test-Driven Development with comprehensive test validation. Follow this rigorous process:

PHASE 1 - SPECIFICATIONS:
[Full specifications requirements]

PHASE 2 - TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT WITH VALIDATION:

FOR EACH FEATURE:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests
2. **TEST VALIDATION** (Critical Step):
   - Explain each test
   - Test the tests with wrong implementation
   - Verify test quality
3. **GREEN**: Write correct implementation
4. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality
5. **QUALITY GATES**: Full validation before next feature

ENHANCED RULES:
- NEVER write implementation before test validation
- Always demonstrate test validation step
- Show incorrect implementation failing tests
- Explain why each test matters

Technology: Python (with language detection libraries)
Show all work: failing tests, test validation, correct implementation, passing tests.
```

**Research Interest**: How does test validation affect development time, test effectiveness, and overall code reliability?

**Success Criteria**:
- Test validation thoroughness
- Test effectiveness at catching bugs
- Code reliability and robustness
- Development process rigor
