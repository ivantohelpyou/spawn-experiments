# Method 3: Test-Driven Implementation

**Approach**: Follow strict Test-Driven Development using Red-Green-Refactor cycles.

**Prompt Used**:
```
Create a multilingual word counter program using Test-Driven Development principles. Follow this exact process:

PHASE 1 - SPECIFICATIONS:
Write detailed specifications including:
1. Core functional requirements
2. User stories with acceptance criteria
3. Technical architecture overview
4. Data models and relationships
5. API design (if applicable)
6. Business rules and validation requirements
7. Error handling and edge cases

PHASE 2 - TDD IMPLEMENTATION:
Using the specifications above, implement using strict TDD:

FOR EACH FEATURE:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal implementation code
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

STRICT RULES:
- NO implementation code before tests
- Tests must fail before writing implementation
- Each commit should follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Start with simplest features first

Technology: Python (with language detection libraries)
Show your work: display tests, show them failing, then show implementation.
```

**Research Interest**: How does the TDD cycle affect code quality, development time, and confidence in correctness?

**Success Criteria**:
- Test coverage and quality
- Code structure and design
- Adherence to TDD process
- Refactoring effectiveness
