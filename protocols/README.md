# Protocols Directory

This directory contains experimental protocols that define how experiments should be conducted.

## Active Protocols

### **EXPERIMENTAL_PROTOCOL_V4.md**
Latest experimental protocol including:
- Phase 0: Public/private branch decision
- Severed branch isolation for clean room methodology comparison
- Task agent execution guidelines
- File persistence requirements

### **CLEAN_ROOM_PROTOCOL.md**
Detailed clean room protocol for:
- Severed git branch isolation
- Zero cross-contamination methodology comparison
- Experimental integrity maintenance

## Historical Context

These protocols evolved through experimental failures:
- **V1**: Basic Task agent execution (failed - persistence issues)
- **V2**: Inline code inclusion requirements
- **V4**: Severed branch isolation breakthrough
- **V4.1**: Parallel execution enhancement

## Usage

All new experiments should follow EXPERIMENTAL_PROTOCOL_V4.md unless specific variations are documented and justified.
